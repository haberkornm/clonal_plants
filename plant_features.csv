1,Justicia,californica,,,"Benson and Darrow 1981, Hickman 1993, Powell 1988, Kearny and Peebles 1979 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Shrub General : Small shrub to 2 m, generally leafless, or, when leaves are present, leaves fairly sparse, especially around the inflorescence. Stems and leaves pubescent with fine, short, white hairs, which give the stems a white appearance. The hairs are not easily visible to the naked eye. Leaves : Leaves ovate to lanceolate, bright green, simple, entire, opposite, and with noticeable venation on the underside of the leaf, to 2 cm long. Flowers : Flowers bright red, orange, or occasionally yellow, with an elongated corolla tube, lobes divided with a large lower lip, lower lip having 3 lobes, the upper lip with 2 lobes. Throat occasionally spotted or streaked with yellow. Sepals subulate and tapering. Stamens 2, the anthers having a hard, white, pointed tip. Fruits : An elongated, club-shaped capsule 1.5-2 cm, canescent, with an inflated tip. Seeds 4, rounded, mottled. Ecology : Found in dry, sandy, soils, in washes and canyons below 2,500 ft (762 m); flowers March-June. Distribution : s AZ, se CA; south to nw MEX Notes : Once the plant has flowered and dropped its leaves and capsules, look for the gray (darkening to brown in winter) pubescent stems and star-shaped sepal remnants to help identify this plant. Differentiate from J. candicans by looking at the anthers; J. californica has a short, hard, white basal point on it's lower anthers, this is absent on J. candicans. Also, the stems of J. californica are obscured by the dense pubescence, while J. candicans is pubescent, its stem is still visible. Ethnobotany : The flowers were sucked for their nectar. Etymology : Justicia is named after after James Justice (1698-1763), a Scottish botanist and horticulturist, son of Sir James Justice. He was apparently the first person to successfully bring a pineapple to the fruiting stage in Scotland, became involved in the tulip bulb craze and died bankrupt, while californica means of or from California.

In Arizona, Trianthema portulacastrum is a host plant of the beet leafhopper (T. H. Kearney and R. H. Peebles 1960). Seed dispersal is achieved by several methods: one seed is dispersed in the detached cap of the capsule, which can float, and the other seeds are either dispersed individually from the capsule or remain on the annual, parent plant where they will germinate and establish new plants where the parent once grew or was deposited.",,"Kearney and Peebles 1969, FNA 2004, Correll and Johnston 1970 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Semisucculent annual herb, emerging during the monsoon season; stems weak and prostrate, 15–60 cm long, reddish green and glabrous. Leaves : Opposite along the stems, on wide succulent petioles; blades obovate to orbicular, 3–5 cm long on robust, young plants, and smaller and thicker, 2 cm long, on older plants; expanded petiole bases and stipules form a membranous sheath around stem. Flowers : Pink-purple and solitary in leaf axils, partly enclosed by the sheath formed by the petiole base; calyx lobes appearing petal-like, 2-3 mm long, pink with a green horn on the back near the tip ; petals absent. Fruits : Capsules cylindrical and curved, 4 mm long, with prominent crests; containing several seeds. Ecology : Found in disturbed areas and fields with sandy, gravelly, or rocky soils, from 1,000–4,000 ft (305–1219 m); flowers June–October. Distribution : sw US and n MEX Notes : This is a common summer annual of the low deserts. Look for it in weedy habitats such as desert washes and Tucson backyards. With its ground-hugging growth form and opposite, spoon-shaped, succulent leaves, it looks just like Portulaca oleracea at first glance. However, this species has tiny pinkish flowers (P. oleracea has yellow flowers); the capsules have 2 crests on top that look a bit like a pair of mouse ears; and the flowers and fruits are partly hidden in the leaf axils, where they are surrounded by a sheath formed by the base of the leaf petioles and stipules. Ethnobotany : Plants are cooked and eaten as greens in summer. Etymology : Trianthema is from Greek treis for three and anthemon for flower; portulacastrum means resembling the genus Portulaca.

Sandy, gravelly slopes, washes, semideserts, disturbed habitats; 500-1700 m; Ariz., Calif., N.Mex., Tex., Utah; n Mexico. Two varieties of Amaranthus fimbriatus have been recognized: var. fimbriatus , with tepals fimbriate at the apex, and var. denticulatus (= A. venulosus S. Watson), with denticulate or crenulate tepals. The latter is reported from Arizona and adjacent northern Mexico; it probably occurs more widely. A related species, Amaranthus chihuahuensis S. Watson, which occurs in Mexico (Chihuahua and Oaxaca), was reported from trans-Pecos Texas, but no reliable specimens were seen by C. F. Reed (1969b).

Ecology : Found in sandy, gravelly slopes, washes, and disturbed habitats below 4,000 ft (1219 m); flowers August-November. Distribution : Ranges across the southwestern deserts from the Utah-Arizona border to Sinaloa. Notes : Similar to A. torreyi, which also has narrow leaves and axillary clusters of flowers grading into leafy terminal spikes. However, A. torreyi has shorter, often wider leaves, up to 2 cm wide, and pistillate tepals with entire margins. FNA recognizes two varieties of A. fimbriatus;  var. denticulatus, with denticulate or crenate tepals, appears to have a more southern distribution in s AZ and MEX, while var. fimbriatus, with fimbriate tepals, is found farther north.

Distribution : Originally native to the American southwest, now widespread across the N. Amer. from n MEX to CAN. Notes : Amaranthus species are notoriously difficult and commonly misidentified. Pay close attention to the following characters and take samples if unsure. A. palmeri distinguished by its erect, annual habit, which can reach 3 m tall in the right conditions; inflorescences of terminal, mostly-leafless spikes, some of these becoming large; occasional small glomerules of flowers but not well-developed spikes in the leaf axils; and male and female flowers on separate plants. Can appear similar to A. powellii and A. hybridus, but those species are monoecious (male and female flowers on the same plant), and have wider, erect spikes found on branch tips and in leaf axils. Ethnobotany : Amaranthus spp. all have similar medicinal qualities. Tea made from leaves is used to relieve stomach pain. Herb stimulates mucous membranes. Leaves mixed with lavender may be steeped in milk for infants that are undergoing continuous vomiting. It has been used for a longer than a millennium for food by various indigenous groups.

Salsola tragus probably was introduced to South Dakota in 1870 or 1874 in flaxseed imported from Russia (J. C. Beatley 1973c; C. W. Crompton and I. J. Bassett 1985; S. L. Mosyakin 1996). Now this noxious weed occupies almost all of its potential range in North America. It seems, however, to be quite rare in the southeastern part of the United States. Salsola tragus has been known in North American and European botanical literature under numerous names (for detailed synonymy see S. L. Mosyakin 1996 and S. Rilke 1999). Judging from the photographs of the Linnaean specimen of S. tragus (LINN 315.3), which should be regarded as a lectotype, it is the correct name for the widespread, narrow-leaved, weedy representative of the S. kali aggregate (Á. Degen 1936-1938, vol. 2; N. N. Tzvelev 1993; S. L. Mosyakin 1996; S. Rilke 1999). In the present circumscription, Salsola tragus is an extremely polymorphic species consisting of several more or less distinct races (subspecies or segregate species). Several varieties may be recognized within S. tragus , many of them are just morphological variants of little or no taxonomic value. Studies using allozymes and DNA-based molecular markers in some North American and Eurasian representatives of Salsola tragus indicate that there are at least two cryptic genetically divergent populations (F. J. Ryan and D. R. Ayres 2000). More studies may clarify distribution, origin, and taxonomic status of these infraspecific taxa (or cryptic species). In spite of being a noxious weed, Salsola tragus is an additional forage source for livestock in arid rangelands.

Suaeda nigra is the correct name for the species previously known as Suaeda moquinii . The type specimen was collected in 1820 by Edwin James along the Canadian River in the Texas panhandle. J. Torrey (1827) tentatively identified it as ' Chenopodium maritimum L. -'. Rafinesque named it Chenopodium nigrum , long before Torrey´s publication of the name Chenopodina moquinii in 1856. C. O. Hopkins and W. H. Blackwell (1977) suggested that the name Chenopodium nigrum was both a nomen nudum and a superfluous name. But the publication of that name included a clear reference to Torrey´s 1832 publication, which means that the name was not a nomen nudum, and the specimen belonged to a new species, which means that the name was not superfluous. ' Suaeda fruticosa ' with the incorrect author combination (Linnaeus) Forsskål has been misapplied to this species (H. J. Schenk and W. R. Ferren Jr. 2001). Suaeda nigra exhibits much phenotypic plasticity, as well as genetic variability, and is wide ranging. This combination has resulted in the naming of many variants that often reflect a response to localized or regional habitat conditions such as degree of wetness, salinity, or freezing temperatures (C. O. Hopkins and W. H. Blackwell 1977). In California and adjacent states, for example, glabrous plants ( S. torreyana var. torreyana ) and pubescent plants ( S. torreyana var. ramosissima ) occur throughout the distribution of the species. In California it is coastal but not estuarine in the San Francisco Bay area and in Orange and San Diego counties. Plants of northern latitudes or higher elevations that are prone to freezing tend to have annual stems from a woody base. Plants that occur in more southern or milder conditions are usually shrubs with perennial stems. Plants in seasonally flooded wetlands tend to be facultative annuals. In the western and northern part of the range, most plants of Suaeda nigra are glabrous or sparsely pubescent and more or less long leaved. In parts of Texas and New Mexico and south into Mexico, densely villous, short-leaved plants occur, often on gypseous soils; they have been called S. suffrutescens var. suffrutescens , and var. detonsa when the flowers and leaves are glabrous. Plants from Texas with thickened and persistent leaf bases and corky-thickened segments of the fruiting perianth have been called S. duripes , known from only two collections that probably represent environmentally stressed individuals. Also in the Southwest, plants that are more herbaceous than S. suffrutescens and have a darker color have been called S. nigrescens .",,"FNA 2004, Heil et al 2013 Common Name : Mojave seablite Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Subshrub Wetland Status : OBL General : Perennial shrub or subshrub, up to 2 m, semi-hemispherical, much branched, branches spreading and interlacing; stems slender and brittle; herbage and calyces minutely and densely pubescent to sometimes glabrous, succulent, green to glacuous blue-green and often reddish purple.

Distribution : Most of the western US, CA north to OR and west to ND; south to c MEX. Notes : This widely distributed shrub is an indicator of soil salinity throughout the West. It is a quite variable species which exhibits phenotypic plasticity depending on environmental conditions, with plants in different regions being more or less pubescent, plants of warmer climates tending toward shrubbiness, and stems of northern plants dying back each year. These various ecotones have previously been described as separate taxa; however, the Flora of North America groups them all as S. nigra. Because the species is so succulent, fresh material looks drastically different from dried material. It may be wise to photograph a specimen in the field to supplement your voucher collection. Ethnobotany : Poultice was used on sores as an analgesic for bleeding bowels, as a ceremonial medicine, rubbed on chicken pox sores, and for bladder and kidney trouble.

Tidestromia lanuginosa shows wide variation; two subspecies can be recognized primarily on the basis of pollen and trichome features (I. Sánchez del Pino and H. Flores Olvera 2002). The trichomes are typically candelabriform with more or less regular branches. In some parts of the plants, the terminal cells of the trichomes have a much greater number of irregular and enlarged branches. The distribution of secondary branches has taxonomic importance if infrataxa are recognized: subsp. lanuginosa has trichomes with the terminal cell projections irregular only; subsp. eliassoniana has trichomes with the terminal cell projections either irregular or spreading (I.

Stems slender, 7-50 cm. Leaves : Highly dissected (3- or 4- pinnatasect) into small, linear segments. Flowers : White to cream, in densely flowered compound umbels on stout peduncles 3-30 cm; subtended by leafy bracts, the bracts at least as long as the umbel branches; sepals absent; petals tiny, 0.6 mm, white to pale yellow. Fruits : Burlike, the body dark colored, 3 mm, intricately sculptured with yellow barb-tipped spines. Ecology : Found in disturbed habitat, below 5,000 ft (1524 m); flowers March to May. Distribution : British Columbia south to CA, east over the south half of the US to VA; south to c MEX and in S. America. Notes : Looks similar and a close relative to the cultivated carrot. The wild progenitor of the cultivated carrot, Daucus carota (known as Queen Anne-s lace) has naturalized in some parts of the US, including California; D. carota can be distinguished from D. pusillus because it is a biennial, is generally taller, up to 1.2 m, and usually has at least 1 purple flower in each umbel. Distinguishing characteristics of D. pusillus are the bristly oblong fruits that have small barbs on the tips of the bristles (a trait of the genus; use a hand lens); the leaves and stems covered with small hairs, and  the fact that it is a fairly small annual, usually ca. 20-30 cm tall, though it can be taller. Look also for the long bracts subtending the umbels, which have the same finely dissected morphology as the leaves and often extend past the flowers. Ethnobotany : Decoction of plant taken to clean the blood, as a remedy for colds, itching, fevers, and snakebite. Roots were gathered and eaten both raw and steamed. Etymology : Daucus is from the Greek dais -to burn- referring to the taste of the carrot root; pusillus means weak, small, or insignificant.

Fruits : Capsule splitting into 2 single seeded mericarps, widely ovate, 1.5-2 mm wide, with prominent ribs and short bristles with hooked tips. Ecology : Found on rocky slopes and sandy flats from 1,000-5,000 ft (305-1524 m); flowers February-May. Distribution : Most of southern US, from CA east to NC; south to n MEX. Notes : Identify this white flowered member of the carrot family by its sparse, open, nearly bractless umbels; delicate leaves divided into threadlike segments; and seeds with hooked bristles. Nesom (2012) segregated western individuals (west of Texas) of this species into a new species and is calling them Spermolepis laterifolia. Appears similar to Yabea microcarpa, but that species has larger fruits, >5mm long, and the stems and leaves are pubescent with hispid hairs. Daucus pusillus is also hairy, has fruits with barbed (rather than hooked) bristles, and the umbels usually have long leafy bracts. Ethnobotany : None.

Dichelostemma capitatum is the most wide-ranging species in the genus, with great variation in habitat, morphology, and chromosome number (G. Keator 1992).  Two subspecies are recognized here, after G. Keator (1991, 1993b), but many other subspecies and even separate species have been recognized.  For example, D. insulare has been recognized because it is endemic to the California Channel Islands and Guadalupe Island and is larger than mainland plants.  Dichelostemma capitatum ranges from northern Mexico through California, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico, and possibly north to Idaho and Washington.  Despite its great intraspecific variability, it is quite distinct from other species in the genus.  It is the only species with six fertile stamens and epigeous germination, and it has unique corm, seed, and ovule characteristics.  It also does not form hybrids with any other species, and it has even been placed in its own genus, Dipterostemon (P. A. Rydberg 1912).  Recent anatomical and molecular data support the idea that this species is not directly related to the other members of Dichelostemma and perhaps is best treated as its own genus (R. Y. Berg 1996; J. C. Pires 2000).",,"FNA 2003 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Perennial scapose herb from a large underground deep-seated corm (bulb); scape to 65 cm tall.

Notes : This 2-3 m tall shrub, which often grows in monospecific stands along low elevation dry washes, has a similar upright but arching growth form as young saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) and can be confused for that species from a distance. Despite this similarity in structure, they can be distinguished from a distance by the stem color (red-brown for Tamarix and light gray-beige for A. monogyra). As one approaches, the identity of A. monogyra becomes obvious due to its sparse, linear-filiform leaves, and achenes clustered in the leaf axils, each achene surrounded by a skirt-like ring of papery bracts. A. salsola is also similar (the two species were formerly placed in the genus Hymenoclea together) but A. salsola is much shorter, less than 1 m tall, and the wings on the achenes are scattered or spirally arranged, while the wings on A. monogyra form an obviously single ring.  A. monogyra thrives on disturbance created by occasional floods; its seeds are transportable by flood, making it an early successional floodplain species. Ethnobotany : Used as a remedy for abdominal pains; the Seri used the seeds for food.

Baccharis salicifolia is part of a complex that extends through the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America to Argentina and Chile (J. Cuatrecasas 1968). It is recognized by the narrowly lanceolate, willowlike, finely serrate leaves with acute or acuminate apices, smallish heads in dense clusters, reddish phyllaries, and 5-nerved cypselae. By tagging and measuring individual plants throughout the year, D. H. Wilken (1972) demonstrated that B. salicifolia has distinct seasonal forms. The North American plants were once known as B. glutinosa or B. viminea , which were differentiated from each other by differences in woodiness, leaf size and serration, and flowering time.",,"FNA 2006, Benson and Darrow 1981, Kearney and Peebles 1969, Heil et al 2013 Common Name : mule-fat Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Shrub Wetland Status : FAC General : Dioecious shrub, 1-4 m tall, with a willow-like architecture; branches long, wand-like, tan.

B. salicifolia is distinguished by the showy white inflorescences; shiny, resinous, sticky, toothed leaves; willow-like, thicket-forming growth habit; and its characteristic habitat of riparian areas. Can be difficult to to distinguish from B. salicina.  B. salicifolia is more willow-like and glutinous; the leaves have evenly and finely serrate margins; and the pappus on the achenes is shorter, 3-6 mm. B. salicina is also somewhat glutinous (sticky); the leaf margins are entire or have 1-4 pairs of teeth on the distal half or two-thirds; and the pappus on the achenes is longer (8-12 mm). B. salicifolia often increases in degraded riparian areas, is not grazed by livestock or wildlife, and is good erosion control. It readily reproduces from stem cuttings along stream channels, and tends to form streamside thickets. Ethnobotany : Used as a hair wash to prevent baldness and as an eyewash; the young shoots were roasted and eaten as a famine food; the stems were mixed with adobe in house construction and used to make arrows for hunting small game.

Stony slopes, mesas, and sandy plains; 100-2000 m; Ariz., Calif., Nev., N.Mex., Tex., Utah; Mexico (Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Sonora). Baileya multiradiata is an attractive and bountiful wild flower over a large part of the desert Southwest. It has been touted as a promising plant for landscaping, and research on its nursery production has begun (D. J. Cotter et al. 1980, 1982). Both Baileya multiradiata and B. pleniradiata produce an antineoplastic pseudoguaianolide, radiatin, which might prove useful in cancer therapy (J. J. Einck et al. 1978). In addition, the antibiotic sesquiterpene lactone, baileyolin, from B. multiradiata inhibits tumor formation (X. A. Dominguez et al. 1977). Baileya multiradiata is reportedly toxic to livestock, especially to sheep and goats, where losses as high as 25% have been reported on overgrazed rangeland in Texas (D. W. Hill et al. 1979, 1980). Cattle and horses seem to be unaffected, or at least poisoning of these animals has gone unreported. The chemical agent responsible is believed to be hymenoxon, a sesquiterpene lactone originally found in the genus Hymenoxys , where it is also toxic. The poorly known desert marigold moth, Schinia minima (Grote), appears to be endemic on Baileya multiradiata , using the heads of this species for its larval development (T. G. Myles and B. F. Binder 1990). The autumnal blossoms of Baileya multiradiata , with smaller heads, fewer rays, and shorter peduncles, greatly resemble those of B. pleniradiata . This has caused much confusion in the distinction between these two species. The shape of the style apex is a useful character to distinguish between fall-blooming specimens.",,"FNA 2006, Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual or short lived perennial herb, 20-40 cm tall; stems decumbent to ascending, branching at base, leafy on lower portions only; herbage floccose-wooly.

Notes : At first glance this species looks like B. multiradiata, which is the most common of the genus. Pay attention to the fact that this species is an annual, where B. multiradiata is biennial to perennial and often is found in much larger clumps. Also, this species has leaves higher up the stems, sometimes to the apex; shorter peduncles (< 12 cm); and acute style branches. B. multiradiata has leaves concentrated at the bottom of the stems; long peduncles (10-30 cm); and truncate or rounded style branches.

Chaenactis stevioides is found throughout the southwestern deserts; it is among the most abundant spring wildflowers in the higher Mojave Desert and southern Great Basin. It also extends seaward into west-central California. It has been reported in New York as a garden escape; it is not expected to persist there outside cultivation. Chaenactis stevioides varies in more or less concentric zones. Plants from the core zone (centered on the Great Basin and Mojave Desert) typically have pappi and phyllaries relatively short and phyllaries predominantly stipitate-glandular (var. brachypappa ). Surrounding this zone to the southwest, southeast, and northeast are plants with pappi and phyllaries relatively long and phyllaries evidently or predominantly lanuginose (var. stevioides ). Scattered on the periphery in central Arizona, Baja California, and west-central and southwestern California (where hybrids may be involved; see sectional discussion) are mesophytic forms with relatively long and/or broad leaf divisions, corollas varying from white to pale yellow, and pappi and phyllaries like those of var. brachypappa (var. thornberi, C. gillespiei ). An unnamed form with leaves arachnoid but otherwise like C. fremontii occurs around sand dunes in the Mojave Desert.

Stems (single or multiple from bases) erect to ascending, densely and evenly puberulous-hirsutulous (hairs spreading to spreading-descending or -ascending, often crinkly, bases not thickened), minutely glandular at least distally, usually throughout. Leaves basal (usually deciduous) and cauline; basal blades obovate-spatulate, 10-70 × 4--14 mm, cauline gradually reduced distally, margins entire or with 2-3 pairs of teeth or lobes, faces hirsute to loosely strigoso-hirsute, sometimes sparsely glandular.

Cypselae 0.9-1.2 mm, 2-nerved (nerves whitish), faces sparsely strigose; pappi: outer of setae or scales, inner of 6-9(-12) bristles. 2 n = 18, 27, 36. Flowering (Feb-)Apr-Oct. Gravelly or sandy flats, riverbanks, meadows, disturbed sites, desert scrubland to grasslands, saltbush, blackbrush, sagebrush, pinyon-juniper, juniper-oak, oak, and ponderosa pine woodlands; 60-2000(-2700) m; Alta., B.C.; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Idaho, Mont., Nebr., Nev., N.Mex., N.Dak., Okla., Oreg., S.Dak., Tex., Utah, Wash., Wyo.; Mexico (Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Sonora, and southward). Polyploidy and agamospermy apparently are common in Erigeron divergens and contribute to the variability and, probably to some extent, the polymorphism characteristic of this species. Diploids appear to be scattered through the range of the species, at least in its southern part. The form of Erigeron divergens with persistent, deeply pinnatifid basal leaves with relatively long petioles and tendency toward perenniality (woody taproots) has been named E. accedens [occurs at 200-1000(-1200) m and flowers Feb-Apr(-May)]. Such plants have sometimes been identified as E. lobatus , and it is possible that they may have originated as hybrids with it; in most ways they are similar to E. divergens and apparently intergrade with it. The E. accedens form occurs in California, Arizona, New Mexico, southwest Texas, Baja California, northern Sonora, Durango, and Chihuahua, apparently sympatrically with more typical E. divergens , suggesting that the former is stabilized and self-reproductive (probably agamospermic). Available chromosome counts are triploid. Rare plants (e.g., E. incomptus ) may have filiform rays barely extending past the involucre. Another common form of Erigeron divergens in the broad sense (mostly in Chihuahua, also southern Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona) has bowl-shaped plants with decumbent stems, a discrete taproot, persistent, lobed basal leaves, and solitary heads topping usually simple stems, and usually is early-season in phenology. Further comments related to variation in E. divergens are found under 163.

Duration : Annual, Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual to short-lived perennial herb from a taproot, 5-50 cm tall; stems branched from base and above, erect to ascending but often weak, and covered with spreading hairs. Leaves : Alternate along the stem, often also with a cluster of basal leaves persisting into adulthood; lower leaves larger, up to 5 cm long, long-petioled, oblanceolate, and entire to slightly lobed; upper leaves smaller,  sessile, and linear in shape. Flowers : Flower heads showy and radiate, with white to purple rays and yellow discs, usually numerous and located on the ends of long leafy peduncles; involucres hemispheric, 4-5 mm high and 7-11 mm wide, the phyllaries in 3-4 series, hirsute, and minutely glandular; ray flowers 75-150 per flower head, the petals 5-10 mm long and  pale blue, pink or white; disc flowers yellow. Fruits : Achenes sparsely hairy, 2-4 veined; topped with an inner pappus of 5-12 long, fragile bristles surrounded by an outer pappus of short, narrow scales. Ecology : Found in a wide variety of habitats including roadsides, riparian zones, woodlands, and forests, from 1,000-9,000 ft (305-2740 m); flowers April-Sept. Distribution : Most of western N. America from the Pacific to the Mississippi; south to s MEX. Notes : Erigeron is a difficult genus, with many similar looking species distingushed from each other by subtle and obscure characters. A hand lens is necessary for field ID, and making a collection is generally advisable in order to have any confidence in a determination.  Identify the genus as a whole from its characteristic daisy-like flowers with white to pale purple rays and yellow centers (although a few species have extremely small rays); involucres with 2-5 series of phyllaries, all about the same length (subequal); and tufts of bristles on the tops of the seeds. E. divergens is possibly the most commmon Erigeron spp. in the southwest; it is  highly variable in growth form, ranging from bushy and dense to upright with few stems and even decumbent. It also grows in a great variety of habitats, from low desert riparian to Ponderosa Pine forest. It is distinguished by being a biennial or short-lived perennial; having stems with spreading hairs (use your hand lens); leaves reduced as you move up the plant, these mostly simple but sometimes wth 2-3 pairs of lobes; and daisy-like flowering heads 7-11 mm in diameter. There are a number of other Erigeon spp. that strongly resemble this one, but E. divergens is by far the most common. Ethnobotany : Aerial parts are sometimes used to make oil to treat pets for fleas (Hence the common name - fleabane). Many Erigeron spp. used similarly. Etymology : Erigeron means Early-Old-Man, as named by Theophrastus;  divergens refers to the divergent, or spreading, hairs on the stems.

Leaves : Mostly alternate, with lower leaves sometimes opposite; petiolate; blades lance-linear to linear, 2-12 cm long, the base tapering into the petiole. Flowers : Flower heads white to pink, discoid, on long peduncles in loose terminal panicles; involucre (ring of bracts wrapped around the flower head) cylindric to narrowly turbinate, the bracts (phyllaries) in 2-3 series, all equal in length, 1-2.5 cm high, more or less scabrous and sometimes stipitate-glandular; florets 9-40, all discs, the corollas pinkish to purplish to whitish, 9-13 mm high. Fruits : Achenes 1-1.5 cm long, obpyramidal, 4-angled, densely to sparsely hairy, topped with a pappus of scales about 1 cm long. Ecology : Found in sandy soils, below 3,000 ft (914 m); flowers late winter to spring, and occasionally into summer. Distribution : AZ, CA, NV, UT; south to MEX (Baja California, Sonora). Notes : This attractive taprooted annual is distinguished by its light pink, narrow-cylindric discoid flower heads; narrow gray-green leaves covered with long white appressed hairs (canescent); and upper stems often covered with short gland-tipped hairs. Some older treatments use the name P. linearis for Arizona material; however, FNA places these specimens in P. arida, claiming that P. linearis is a Mexican species that does not reach as far north as the US border. Variety gigantea is sometimes recognized within this species; these are unusually large plants, 90-150 cm tall with phyllaries 16-25 mm long, from the sand dunes west of Yuma, Arizona. Ethnobotany : Cahuilla used it to make a yellow dye. Etymology : Palafoxia is named to honor General Jos_ Palafox (1776-1847) a Spanish patriot; arida means dry land.

Sandy, gravelly washes and slopes in desert shrub communities, juniper woodlands, open, sandy short-grass plains; 200-1500 m; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Kans., Nev., N.Mex., Okla., Tex., Utah, Wyo.; Mexico (Chihuahua, Sonora). Stephanomeria pauciflora generally grows as an intricately branched, often rounded bush. Occasional plants, usually from Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and southern Utah, have long, flexuous stems and branches, an architecture that resembles one of the typical forms of S. tenuifolia . Some plants of S. pauciflora have white pappi, also typical of S. tenuifolia . It is not known if these plants represent uncommon and unusual individuals or if they are from populations in which all plants have those traits. It is also not known whether such plants of S. pauciflora grow near populations of S. tenuifolia ; if so, they may result from interspecific hybridization. That is a possibility; experimental hybrid plants produced by crossing individuals from the two species were about 20% fertile. Such fertility suggests the species are sufficiently compatible that fully fertile segregants with variously intermediate morphologies could be expected where they hybridize in nature. The experimental crosses were made reciprocally between S. pauciflora from Riverside County, California ( L. D. Gottlieb 6653 ), and S. tenuifolia from Wheeler County, Oregon ( L. D. Gottlieb 6692 ); specimens of the six F1 hybrid plants that were produced are deposited at DAV.

The following two binomials, referable here, are not valid because the name Sideranthus was invalid (nomen nudum) when the combinations were published: S. pinnatifidus Nuttall, and S. spinulosus (Pursh) Sweet. Furthermore, Eriocarpum australe Greene, probably also referable here, although validly published, has never been typified. The relevant synonyms are: Haplopappus spinulosus subsp. australis (Greene) H. M. Hall and Machaeranthera australis (Greene) Shinners. Over many parts of its range, this species is represented by a series of morphologically distinct populations in isolated mountain ranges now connected by roads. The relatively mesic road right-of-ways form corridors for migration, thus leading to gene exchange. Likewise, long distance dispersal has helped to 'blend' many of these previously isolated and distinctive forms. Xanthisma spinulosum 'is an exceedingly complex, variable taxon. It is doubtful that any `absolute´ key can be constructed so as to recognize unequivocally the infraspecific entities proposed here. Instead, we have composed a key that attempts to recognize character trends that serve, in combination, to distinguish a given taxon from another, but the occasional (if not frequent) specimen will be found that keys to a given regional variety but belongs to yet another. However, if one accepts the exception and recognizes our account as an attempt to portray variable, regional populations and not as a key to individuals, then little trouble should be experienced in pinning a varietal name on this or that collection' (B.

America from  Manitoba south to TX, west to CA and south to s MEX. Notes : Currently classified in Xanthisma, this species has formerly been placed in several other genera including Machaeranthera, Aster, and Happlopappus. Look for a perennial, sometimes woody at the base; flower heads with yellow rays and disks and phyllaries tipped with a white bristle; seeds with a tuft of bristles attached to the top; and leaves which are deeply lobed or toothed, each tooth tipped with a white bristle (though some leaves are linear and mostly lack teeth). Identify it as a member of the Machaeranthera/ Aster group by its flower heads with multiple rows of phyllaries, the outer much shorter than the inner, all with straw colored bases and dark green spots at the tip. However, it is easily distinguished from most members of the Machaeranthera/ Aster group by its yellow ray flowers (blue, purple and white are most common with other members of the group). Appears most similar to Xanthisma gracile, which also has yellow ray flowers, but that species is annual with a herbaceous base. Ethnobotany : The Navajo used it to cure headaches.

Look for carpets of it especially beneath mesquite and palo verde trees in the late winter and early spring. Before flowering it appears as a narrow rosette of ascending, narrowly lanceolate leaves and resembles an annual grass with wide blades; at this stage it is identifiable as Amsinckia because the leaves are covered with bristly hairs. Amsinckia tessellata is also present in the low deserts; the two species are told apart by the nutlets, which are dorally keeled in this species and not in A. tessellata, and the calyx, which in A. tessellata usually has 3 lobes of unequal width, due to some of the lobes being fused together.

Amer., in every state west of the Mississippi, north to AK and south to n MEX; also in S. America. Notes : A small annual herb, fuzzy all over, with narrow leaves and tiny white to light blue flowers; the fruits are distinctive, being 4 nutlets with marginal, hooked prickles which attach to the socks of passers by. Two varieties are found in Arizona: var. cupulata is a multi-stemmed plant with the nutlet prickles confluent into a swollen, cup-shaped base; var. occidentalis is a single or few-stemmed plant with nutlet prickles slightly confluent at the base but not swollen. Distinguish from L. squarrosa by the nutlets which in that species have at least 2 rows of slender, distinct marginal prickles. L. occidentalis has been considered synonymous with L. redowskii but Heil et al.-s recent San Juan Flora claims that L. redowskii is an Old World species that does not exist in North America.

Flowers : Crowded scorpioid cymes, nearly sessile, 5 calyx lobes oblanceolate to oblong, 2-3 mm long, acute, glandular-hirsute, funnelform corolla lavender, 5-6 mm long, lobes rounded, mostly entire, stamens and styles much exserted. Fruits : Subglobose capsule, glandular-hirtellous with dark brown, minutely pitted seeds. Ecology : Found on dry, rocky, or gravelly slopes; 4,500-5,500 ft (1372-1676 m); flowers April-June. Distribution : AZ, sw NM; south to n MEX. Notes : Phacelias are often hairy all over with pinnate leaves and most have an inflorescence curled like a scorpions tail (scorpoid cyme).They are notoriously difficult, make sure you have leaves, flowers and mature fruits to correctly identify most species. This species is part of the -crenulata complex- where many species and races often have overlapping and variable characters and are widely misidentified. Best to get a voucher but can be semi- distinct by its stem leaves which are shallowly lobed, oblong-egg-shaped and at the ends of petioles; glandular-hirsute foliage; and purple corollas with exserted stamens. Many of the collections of this bombycina in Arizona have been found along washes, or in gravelly soils and steep banks. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genera have uses. Etymology : Phacelia from Greek phacelo- for bundle, while bombycina likely derives from the latin bombycinus, silken, of silk, or silky.

Distribution : c and s CA, NV, UT, w CO, AZ, NM, s TX; south into n MEX. Notes : Positive field identification of Phacelia is quite difficult as species delimitations usually rely on seed morphology. This species distinguished by the deeply pinnatifid leaves, with lower lobes cleft to the midrib and upper lobes more shallowly cleft; upper stem leaves sessile or nearly so; scorpoid (curled) inflorescences; flowers with purple bell-shaped corollas and yellow stamens exserted at least 3 mm beyond the corolla; calyx lobes broad and pointed and little or not surpassing the fruit; and seeds more than 3 mm long, which are corrugate with ridges on the margins of the excavated side. Note that this plant can cause an allergenic response to its hairs. There are several subspecies: var. ambigua is common in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and southern California, with herbage that is hispid-hirsute with long, very slender hairs, in addition to the gland-tipped hairs. Var. corrugata is common on the Colorado Platau, from the Grand Canyon and Flagstaff area, east to the White Mountains and central New Mexico, and north to Utah and western Colorado; it has leaves that are quite glandular, long and narrow, and evenly lobed no more than halfway to the midrib. Var. crenulata is most common in the Mojave and Great Basin deserts, from the Yuma area to northern Nevada and central Utah; it has a mixture of long and short non-glandular hairs on the stems, in addition to the gland-tipped hairs. Var. angustifolia is restricted to northern Arizona near the Grand Canyon and neighboring southern Utah; it has long, narrow leaves, similar to var. corrugata, but the lobes on the leaves can be cleft more than halfway to the midrib. The genus Phacelia has at different times been placed in Hyrophyllaceae (the water-leaf family) and Boraginaceae (the borage family), so you may need to check both families before finding it in reference books and herbarium cabinets. Ethnobotany : Keres make root tea for sore throat and into rub for swellings. Etymology : Phacelia is based on the Greek phakelos, meaning ""cluster,"" alluding to the densely crowded flower spikes of most species of the genus; crenulata refers to the rounded teeth on the edges of the leaves.

Leaves : Often clustered at nodes along the stems; on short petioles 2-7 mm long; blades ovate to elliptic, thick, 7-10 mm long and 2-7 mm wide, the base and tips obtuse to broadly acute, and the margins revolute (rolled toward leaf underside); surfaces densely covered with white hairs, making the leaves appear whitish or silvery. Flowers : Pink to white and fairly inconspicuous; usually sessile and solitary in axils of leaves; calyx 4-6 mm long, with 5 long-attenuate lobes, these fused at the base and white-hairy throughout; corolla funnel-shaped, 5-6 mm long, pinkish, rose, or rarely white. Fruits : Spherical, 2-3 mm diameter, splitting into 4 bony nutlets, these 2 mm high, minutely tubercled, glabrous or hairy at maturity. Ecology : Found on dry slopes, often in limestone soils, below 5,500 ft (1067-1676 m); flowers March-September. Distribution : s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, s NM, s TX; south to s MEX. Notes : Distinctive with its low, spreading growth form; woody, sometimes blackish stems; small, densely hairy, oval-shaped leaves with pointed tips; and small pink funnel-shaped flowers buried in the leaves. Similar to T. plicata and T. nuttallii, but those species have leaves with deeply impressed veins, making the leaves look pleated (plicate). T. hispidissima has narrower leaves covered with with bristle-like hairs, rather than the white canescence on this species. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genus have uses. Etymology : Tiquilia is derived from a vernacular name for this genus from the original collections in Peru, while canescens means covered in short gray or white hairs.

Ecology : Found in variety of soils and conditions, below 8,000 ft (2438 m); flowers April-August. Distribution : Throughout N. Amer. except for AK and Yukon, CAN. Notes : Descurainia is a genus of weedy-looking mustards with feathery, pinnately lobed leaves, racemes of inconspicuous white to yellow flowers, and narrow seed pods. The raceme is compact when in flower and then expands substantially in fruit so that the seed pods are well-spaced along the stalk. To distinguish among the various species of Descurainia, focus on the shape, size, and orientation of the seed pods.  D. pinnata has seed pods which are a bit wider and rounded at the tip compared to the base (clavate, or club-shaped), about 1 cm long, not constricted between the seeds, and the pods point upwards even though the pedicels tend to be more horizontal or only slightly upward pointing. D. obtusa and D. sophia both have narrow (1 mm wide), linear seed pods longer than 1 cm 1  which are slightly constricted between the seeds and can be horizontal or upward pointing. There are 2 subspecies in our area. Subsp. glabra has glabrous central stalks of the racemes, and subsp. ochroleuca has canescent (white-woolly) stems and rose-colored or purple sepals. Host plant for Spring White, Checkered White, Pearly Marble, and Sara Orangetip butterflies. Ethnobotany : Edible greens and seeds. Tansy mustard appears in clan names and migration tales as an important plant.

North American records of Lepidium apetalum Willdenow mostly represent misidentifications of L. densiflorum . The latter has obovate fruits widest beyond the middle, whereas L. apetalum has elliptic fruits widest at the middle. The number and limits of the varieties recognized in Lepidium densiflorum , as well as the characters used to delimit them, vary among authors (A. Thellung 1906; C. L. Hitchcock 1936; G. A. Mulligan 1961; R. C. Rollins 1993; N. H. Holmgren 2005b). The variation almost always does not correlate with geography, and the recognition of varieties in this species is neither practical nor very useful. All of those authors admitted that these varieties are 'very weak at best' (Rollins, p. 554). Of them, perhaps var. pubicarpum (including var. elongatum ) might merit recognition. It is distributed in almost all of the Mountain and Pacific states and is distinguished from the other varieties solely by the presence of trichomes or minute papillae on the fruit valves. The density of these trichomes ranges from moderate and covering the entire valve surface to very sparse and represented by individual papillate trichomes restricted to the valve margin. Furthermore, the length of these trichomes may vary from ca. 0.01 to 0.3 mm. In some species (e.g., L. dictyotum ) both glabrous- and pubescent-fruited forms occur, yet none of the above authors gave formal recognition to both forms. It is not known if both glabrous and puberulent fruits occur within the same population in L. densiflorum . The species is autogamous, but nothing is known about the rates of gene flow between and within populations.",,"FNA 2010, Jepson 2012, Allred and Ivey 2012, Heil et al. 2013 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual to biennial herbs, 10-65 cm tall, from slender taproots; stems erect, usually solitary and simple at the base, branching distally; herbage puberulent to glabrous; plants with pungent, watery sap.

Lyro c arpa coulteri , which is known from Pima and Yuma counties in Arizona and Imperial and San Diego counties in California, is extremely variable in nearly every aspect. The leaves range from relatively large, thin, and sparsely pubescent to smaller, thicker, and almost canescent; their shapes and margins are highly variable also. The flowers are strongly scented at night and appear to be moth-pollinated; their color varies a great deal. Fruit shape and size depend on the original number of ovules and how many of them mature into seeds, and one sometimes finds on the same plant fruits ranging from broadly obcordate to panduriform. Finally, the plants occupy a wide array of habitats; they can be tall, slender, and broad- and thin-leaved when grown in the shade of larger shrubs, whereas those growing in direct sunlight can be shorter, stout, and small- and thick-leaved. With the above in mind, it is easy to understand why the two varieties recognized by R. C. Rollins (1941b, 1993) do not merit recognition. Variety apiculata was based on a fragmentary specimen with narrow petals and broad leaves apiculate at lobe apices and teeth. However, these two characters are uncorrelated. Similarly, var. palmeri was distinguished from var. coulteri by having broadly obcordate versus pandurifom fruits and 6-10 ovules, instead of 8-16 ovules, per ovary.

Thysanocarpus curvipes is the most widespread and variable species in the genus. Variants have been named as varieties or species, but they grade into each other imperceptibly. Notable among these are var. elegans , a form with incised or perforate fruit wings, and var. eradiatus , a form with rayless, entire wings. Some of these may be the result of hybridization with other taxa. For instance, var. elegans has large fruits and occurs in the vicinity of T. radians , the largest-fruited member of the genus. Furthermore, fruits of var. elegans often have pointed hairs like those usually found on fruits of T. radians ; such hairs are not found on fruits of any other members of the genus. Thysanocarpus curvipes includes both diploid and tetraploid populations (M. D. Windham, unpubl.), but these do not appear to segregate into recognizable groups.

Leaves : Oblong to elliptic or linear, 12-60 cm long, dentate to shallowly lobed, middle and upper cauline sessile, entire to dentate, base lobed, clasping stem. Flowers : Racemes without bracts, sepals about 1 mm, often purplish with a white margin, petals white or purple tinged, just exceeding the sepals. Fruits : Silicle elliptic to round, 5-8 mm, hairy or not, wing entire, wavy-margined or crenate, often perforated, pedicel recurved, 4-7 mm. Ecology : Found on slopes, in washes, and desert scrub below 7,000 ft (2134 m); flowers March-May. Notes : This species is named fringepod because of the distinctive margins of the silicle, that makes it hard to not know this plant as it is fruiting in spring. Ethnobotany : Taken for stomachaches and the seeds were used in pinole mixtures. Etymology : Thysanocarpus comes from Greek thusanos, fringe and karpos, fruit, which is a reference to the fringed silique, while curvipes means with curved feet or stalks.

General : Shrub-sized cactus, 0.5-1.5 m tall; stems jointed and branching mostly at right angles with an alternate branching pattern; stem segments gray-green or purplish, cylinder shaped, 2-8 cm long and 3-6 mm in diameter, with linear tubercles which look like elongate wrinkles when dried (tubercles are the regularly-spaced bumps along the stems; the tip of each tubercle has an areole with a cluster of spines emerging from it). Terminal stem joints are usually spineless. Spines : Spines emerge from broadly elliptic, woolly white to yellow areoles which turn gray with age. Spines usually 0-1 per areole, but occasionally up to 3 per areole; spines are erect, flexible, straight or arching, terete with an angular-flattened base; spine color is red-brown with grey-white coating and yellow at the tip; the longest spines are 14-45 mm long. Each spine has a grey, purple-grey, or yellow sheath, unless it fell off already. Each areole also has a tuft of yellow or reddish brown glochids (fine barbed bristles), 1-5 mm long. Flowers : Petals numerous, pale yellow to greenish yellow and sometimes red-tipped, narrowly obovate, 5-8 mm long, with a small pointed tip; stamens numerous, with filaments that are greenish-yellow, topped with yellow anthers; style yellow, topped with a ring of greenish-yellow stigma lobes. Fruits : Fruits fleshy, red (occasionally yellow), smooth or covered in minute glochids, obovoid, 1-3 cm long and 6-12 mm wide, with 16-20 areoles; seeds round to square-ish, 3-5 mm wide, pale-yellow.

Distribution : AZ, NM, TX, s OK; south to n MEX. Notes : Commonly known as Christmas cactus, this species is distinguished by the narrow stems (only about 1/2 cm in diameter) and the bright red fruits. This plant grows much taller when growing in a nurse plant association with mesquite or palo verde. Ethnobotany : Fruits were used to sweeten and add potency to tulbai, a beer-like beverage made by fermenting sprouted corn; the small fruits were also eaten raw. Etymology : Cylindropuntia comes from kylindros, for the cylinder-shaped stem segments, and the related genus Opuntia, from which this genus was segregated. Leptocaulis means slender-stemmed.

Historically, E. engelmannii has been characterized as having the abaxial central spine in each areole particularly long, pale, and strongly compressed dorsiventrally (sharply angled, hence daggerlike), contrasting with the other spines. In practice that trait is not always diagnostic. Plants called Echinocereus engelmannii var. acicularis L. D. Benson are essentially morphologically and geographically intermediate between those referred to E. fasciculatus and E. engelmannii var. chrysocentrus . The history of confusion with Echinocereus nicholii has resulted in misidentification of yellow-spined individuals of E. engelmannii. Spine color polymorphism, common within Echinocereus engelmannii, provided the original basis for varieties chrysocentrus and purpureus . The well-marked, identifiable extremes often occur in populations that include individuals easily assigned to other named varieties, or not assignable to any. L. D. Benson (1969, 1982) and subsequent authors (e.g., N. P. Taylor 1985; W. Blum et al. 1998) have attempted to recognize infraspecific taxa within E. engelmannii. However, one of those is clearly a distinct species ( E. nicholii ), while the remainder are either too poorly defined or too poorly known to treat fully here. At higher elevations beyond the western edge of the desert, E. engelmannii var. munzii (Parish) P. Pierce & Fosberg has been distinguished by its curving, twisting, gray spines, somewhat resembling spines of westernmost plants of E. triglochidiatus var. mojavensis. Plants of the western Sonoran Desert margin in the Mexican boundary region in California are the typical E. engelmannii var. engelmannii. Similar plants from the opposite, eastern, side of the Sonoran Desert, in Arizona, have been called E. engelmannii var. acicularis L. D. Benson. In the intervening Colorado River Valley is spinier E. engelmannii var. chrysocentrus (Engelmann & J. M. Bigelow) Rümpler. In E. engelmannii var. acicularis at the lowest altitudes, central spines are usually four, in which cases taxonomic segregation from E. engelmannii var. chrysocentrus seems arbitrary. At higher altitudes, plants of E. engelmannii var. acicularis with only one or two central spines per areole are frequent, and the abaxial central spine may be terete instead of angular and daggerlike as in E. engelmannii var. chrysocentrus. The most formidably spiny extremes of the species were segregated as E. engelmannii vars. howei and armatus ; however, other individuals in the original populations (type localities) are readily assigned to E. engelmannii var. chrysocentrus. W. Blum et al. (1998) placed all of the above varieties under E. engelmannii subsp. engelmannii. Plants smaller in all parts and with fewer central spines from north-centra",,"Benson 1969, FNA 2003 Common Name : Engelmann's hedgehog cactus Duration : Perennial Protected Status : No status in Arizona. General : Perennial succulent with 3-60 stems that are in open to dense masses or mounds 30-60 cm across with erect cylindric stems that are tapering near top, usually 3-9 cm wide, each with 10-13 ribs, the crests slightly undulate, with areoles 6-10 mm apart. Spines : Usually 15-20 spines per areole, these are usually straight but of variable color, there are 6-14 radial-spines per areole about 8-20 mm long. There are 4-6 central spines per areole, these are divergent and extended forward, with the  lower central spine often fading whitish and flat to sharply angled (terete in some areas). Flowers : Tepals rose pink to magenta and varying from paler to darker, overall the flowers are 6-9 cm long and 5-9 cm wide, with a flower tube 13-30 mm by 10-30 mm, the tepal tips thin, and bearing delicate yellow anthers. Fruits : Fleshy fruit red or orangish, 25-45 mm with whitish pulp becoming infused with pink or red. Skin thin, with large and readily detachable spine clusters; fruit juicy, edible; seeds black, tuberculate. Ecology : Found in gravelly, sandy, or rocky soils from 2,000-5,000 ft (610-1524 m), flowers March-April. Distribution : s UT to Sonora and Baja Calif., MEX. Notes : There is extensive variation in this species. For that matter, there are many varieties. FNA discusses some of this variation and the difficulties in distinguishing them. The Benson 1969 key has the separation between E. engelmanii and other species as being the basally flattened principal spine, which is sharp angled in cross section, this species also always has 4 or more central spines according to FNA. Key to field ID are the 4-6 long twisted central spines, 6-14 radial spines, all of which are yellow to white. Ethnobotany : The ripe fruits were eaten raw or boiled and then eaten. Etymology : Echinocereus is from the Greek echinos, hedgehog or spine and cereus, waxy, while engelmannii is named for Georg Engelmann (1809-1884) a German born, American botanical collector.

The stems of Ferocactus wislizeni commonly lean southward, hence the vernacular name, compass barrel. Eventually they fall to the ground from their own weight, uprooting themselves. Introgressive hybridization with Ferocactus cylindraceus is thus far not documented, but is often invoked as an explanation for difficulty in identifying individual specimens in or near the wide region of sympatry. The putative hybrids mostly vanish with sufficient expertise in identifying the 'parental' species. Ferocactus wislizeni barely extends into Mexico, where two allopatric species, F. tiburonensis (G. E. Lindsay) Backeberg and F. herrerae J. G. Ortega, often are cited as varieties of F. wislizeni .

Cercidium-Larrea-Olneya-Carnegiea communities, around washes, on sandy [gravelly] soils; 400-500 m; Ariz.; Mexico (Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Sonora). Pachycereus schottii is primarily a Mexican species occuring in southernmost Arizona only in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument at nine sites very close to the international boundary, where winter temperatures do not generally reach freezing. The Arizona populations do not appear to be experiencing much recruitment via seeds, but persist by vegetative propagation. In Mexico, plant height, rib number, and rib shape vary considerably with microhabitat. In subtropical thorn forest P. schottii may be a small tree with a very short trunk. Three varieties of P. schottii were formally recognized (G. S. Lindsay 1963) but need to be re-examined using DNA techniques. If varieties or subspecies are accepted, Arizona populations would represent the typical form. In contrast to other species of Pachycereus, P. schottii and its narrowly restricted cousin P. gatesii of Baja California Sur, Mexico have the smallest flowers and seeds and the most fleshy and naked fruits. The flowering portion of each adult stem always has long, grayish bristles, inspiring the anthropomorphic vernacular names referring to old age. The moth Upiga virescens (Pyralidae) is the obligate pollinator of Pachycereus schottii , forming a mutualistic system comparable with the yucca and yucca moth (J. N. Holland and T. H. Fleming 1999, 1999b; R. S. Felger and A. D. Zimmerman 2000). In populations near the inter-national border, flowers of P. schottii open ten minutes after sunset (J. N.

Flowers : Nocturnal and lateral on stems with several per areole, usually on middle or transitional areoles, short funnel form 2.5-4 cm long 2-4 cm in diameter, the floral tube scaly and rose colored, the tepals spreading to being reflexed in morning, with pink-orange center, the stamens white and short. Fruits : Candy apple red at maturity, few scaled and spineless, splitting irregularly, ovoid to subspheric, 2.5-4 cm long. Ecology : Found in flats along washes and on low hills, preferring sandy, lava, or granitic substrates from 1,000-2,000 ft (305-610 m), flowers March-September. Distribution : Found in the warmest parts of the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, then south to Sinaloa, and south on the Baja California. Notes : This species is one of the big cacti that have a beautiful upright thicket, similar in this respect to organ pipe cacti. This species is easily distinguished by virtue of the fuzzy gray appearance of the upper parts of the stems, which gives it the other common name of old man cactus. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genera had a number of uses. Etymology : Pachycereus comes from the Greek pachys for thick and the Latin cereus meaning a tapered candle, while schottii is named for Arthur Carl Victor Schott (1814-1875) a naturalist on the Mexican Boundary Survey.

Spines (19-)26-33(-38) per areole, glabrous; radial spines 17-35 per areole whitish or pale tan, bristlelike, 6-12 × 0.1-0.15 mm, stiff; central spines (2-)3-4 per areole, 1-3(-4) spines at least hooked (uncommonly 0 hooked), reddish to purplish brown to almost black (rarely golden brown), abaxial 1 porrect, others inconspicuous, appressed against radial spines, hookless porrect spines (3-)9.5-25 × 0.1-0.5 mm; subcentral spines 1-3 per areole, adaxial to central spines, sometimes transitional to central spines, usually straight and barely distinguishable from radial spines. Flowers ca. 2 × 1.8-3.5(-4.5) cm; outermost tepal margins minutely fringed; inner tepals bright rose-pink or rose-purple, 10-16 × 4-8 mm; stigma lobes yellow-green to green, 3-7 mm. Fruits green, turning bright red, scarlet, or carmine (rarely yellowish), elongating until clavate after color change to red is complete, 12-29 × 5-8 mm, juicy only in fruit walls; floral remnant persistent. Seeds black, 0.8-1 × 0.7-0.9 mm, pitted; testa hard, brittle; anticlinal cell walls straight; interstices conspicuously wider than pit diameters; pits bowl-shaped. 2 n = 22. Flowering Apr-Sep; fruiting Sep-Mar.

Mammillaria grahamii is geographically variable. Past attempts to distinguish larger or western individuals as M. microcarpa have proven arbitrary. All spine hooks on a plant may be oriented in the same direction, a trait sometimes mistakenly said to be limited to Mammillaria mainiae . Plants with short, straight central spines (rarely a mixture of both hooked and straight spines on the same stem) occur in some populations; they have been called M. oliviae or M. grahamii var. oliviae . The name Mammillaria microcarpa Engelmann has been widely used but was not validly published until after M. grahamii .",,"Benson 1969, Benson 1982, FNA 2003 Common Name : Graham's nipple cactus Duration : Perennial Protected Status : Salvage restriced status in Arizona. General : Low globular cactus that is either branched or unbranched plant with 0-9 branches and diffuse roots, the stems are spheric to cylindric and 5-16 cm tall by 3.5-7 cm wide with tubercles that are 5-12 mm by 3.5-7 mm with axils that appear naked. Spines : Spines 26-33 per areole and glabrous, with 17-35 radial spines that are whitish or pale tan and bristlelike, these 6-12 mm long and less that 1 mm wide and stiff, the 3-4 central spines have 1-3 hooked ones which are reddish to purplish brown to black and the others shorter, less colored and straight. Flowers : Roughly 2 cm by 2 cm with the outermost tepal margins minutely fringed with inner tepals that are bright rose pink to rose purple, 10-16 mm long by 4-8 mm wide, with stigma lobes that are yellow green to green and 3-7 mm. Fruits : Fleshy fruits green turning bright red, scarlet to carmine, they are barrel shaped and elongating until the color change is complete, often with the floral remnants. Ecology : Found on silty, sandy, gravelly, or rocky soils, often on slopes in the chaparral and grasslands from 2,000-5,000 ft (610-1524 m); flowers April-September, fruits September-March. Distribution : s CA, AZ, s NM, TX; south to n MEX. Notes : Distinguished by being erect with tubercles; hooked central spines; no nipples visible; the flowers ringed around towards the top but not at the apex of the 4-7 cm wide stem; and the 2.5 cm wide pink tepals which are not or only minutely fringed, and are followed by elongated bright red fruits. There are quite a few varieties, at least historically. The systematics according to FNA seem to make this a geographically variable species, rather than making species distinctions. Benson 1969 listed two varieties. Ethnobotany : The dried fruit was cooked and eaten, as was the raw fruit, it was boiled and placed warm in the ear for earaches, and the raw pulp was eaten, primarily by children as a snack food. Etymology : Mammillaria from the Latin mammilla, a nipple, while grahamii is named for James Duncan Graham (1799-1865), he was the astronomer for the survey of the final boundary between Mexico and the United States in 1851.

Notes : There are four recognized varieties: var. engelmannii, var. flavispina, var. lindheimeri, and var. linguiformis. Consult Pinkava 2003 for clarification of a variety type. The systematics of this species and O. phaeacantha still appear to remain unresolved, perhaps due to hybridization.  The variability of these species is significant and as such other texts should be consulted to clearly distinguish among them. Overall, good characters for easy identification are the larger size of plants, being several segments(pads) tall, the large pads, with generally three visible central spines, often with spines and obvious patches of sparse glochids in areoles over the entire pad; and the consistently golden- yellow flower petals, whereas other species have various colored bases. Ethnobotany : A poultice of the heated plant applied to the breasts was an aid for breast-feeding; the ripe tunas (fruit) are eaten fresh, dried, ground, mixed with corn meal, used as a red dye, fermented for a beverage, and made into a syrup; the tender pads are eaten as nopalitos. Etymology : Opuntia is from Latin root puncti for prickled; engelmannii is named for Georg Engelmann (1809-1884) a German born, American botanical collector.

Upland Sonoran desert scrub; 20-1100 m; Ariz.; Mexico (Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Sonora). Stenocereus thurberi is a common columnar cactus of the Sonoran Desert, throughout Baja California and the islands of the Gulf of California and in the west-coastal vegetation from Sonora to Sinaloa. In Mexico, where S. thurberi is arborescent, it has a very short trunk to 0.5 m, exceeds 12 m, branches more than in northern populations, and can have as few as 12 ribs. Tall specimens of S. thurberi occur where the plants grow in taller vegetation, hence competing with small trees for sunlight (A. C. Gibson and P. S. Nobel 1986). Stenocereus thurberi belongs to the largest clade of Stenocereus wherein all species possess dark red or brown, glandular areolar trichomes (A. C. Gibson 1988). The group of species most closely related to S. thurberi have the interareolar transverse fold, a distinctive mark that persists after the ribs become fully expanded.","JANAS 29(1) Plant : Shrubs to 6 m tall.

After a reevaluation of the characters used in their key, we feel that those entities are best regarded as geographical races of the species. This is justified largely by both the overlap in expressions of and the lack of correlation of the characters. Barneby and Twisselmann placed major emphasis on habit and stature, including the position of the primary dichotomy of the plant and the location of intermediate monochasial branching subsequent to last branching, if present. In their words, 'We have developed an objective formula for describing the permutations of branching, but believe that the intangible quality of habit permits intuitive sorting of material into categories that coincide with comprehensive dispersal patterns.'

Wickens (1984) proposed five varieties, four partly in the flora area, where they have largely overlapping ranges and overlapping characteristics. Further, some supposed differences probably result from local and year-to-year rainfall differences.

Flowering spring. Dry, rocky slopes and canyon walls in desert mountains; 100-1100[-1500] m; Ariz., Calif., Nev., Utah; Mexico (Baja California, Sonora). The diploid Dudleya arizonica is closest to the diploid D. pulverulenta , looking like a reduced desert form, smaller in most parts, or sometimes like a seedling. Northward, the ranges are well separated, and southward in Baja California, where both are more sporadic, the ranges and the plants seem mainly distinct. Southward, D. pulverulenta makes large plants like those in the far northern part of its range, whereas southward D. arizonica generally is smaller and less like D. pulverulenta and more like just any old dudleya. In eastern San Diego County, California, the two intergrade and it is hard to draw a line between them. In coastal San Diego County, California, the type region, plants of D. pulverulenta are generally smaller and less extreme than those to the north and south and a little more like D. arizonica . For these reasons, I formerly treated D. arizonica as a subspecies (R. V. Moran 1943b), and something may still be said for that treatment. Because they are generally quite different through much of their broad ranges, it seems better to treat them as different species. The inflorescence of Dudleya pulverulenta and D. anthonyi Rose is approached in some plants of D. arizonica . The mostly ascending branches are sometimes twisted at the base, putting the flowers on the abaxial side, the flowers are sometimes spreading or even pendent, and the fruiting pedicels commonly are more or less bent upward. Because the leaves are fewer and, with the thinner caudex, narrow at the base, seedlings of D. pulverulenta may closely resemble adult plants of D. arizonica .","JANAS 27(2) ROSETTES : solitary, subsessile, 0.5-2(-6) dm wide, of 10-40 leaves, on stems 1-4 cm thick.

Vegetative : Leaves clustered at base of stem; blades elongate and grass-like, 3-8 mm wide; inflorescence is subtended by a whorl of leaf-like bracts, these elongate, unequal in length, and sometimes wider than the true leaves at the base of the plant. Inflorescence : Spikelets borne in open (seldom short and congested), cylindric spikes with more or less elongate rachis, the terminal spike or cluster of spikes sessile, others borne singly or in small groups at the ends of rays up to 7 cm long; spikes slender, 0.5-5 cm long, 2-3 mm wide; scales subtending each flower mostly 3 mm long, several-nerved, broad and much overlapping laterally, but not closely set, with the tip of each scale surpassing the next by 1-2 mm; rachilla narrowly hyaline-winged, persistent. Ecology : Found on moist, low ground along streams and ditches, from 4,000-8,000 ft (1219-2438 m); flowers August-September. Distribution : Cosmopolitan, introduced throughout the world; throughout N. Amer. in every state in the US except MT and WY; south through MEX to S. Amer. Notes : Distinguished by being an erect perennial nutsedge from thin, inconspicuous rhizomes; resmbles C. odoratus but is distinguished by the spikelets which are generally wider, greater than 1.5 mm wide, and which break off at the base, leaving the naked winged inflorescence branch (rachilla) behind on the plant. C. odoratus is an annual with generally narrower spikelets, about 1 mm wide, with inflorescence branches (rachillas) that split apart between the spikelets, so that each spikelet takes a small section of rachilla with it and there are no naked rachillas left on the plant. C. esculentus has 3 varieties in North America, but these may not be worth distinguishing because the speciemens, at least those in New Mexio, exhibit continuous variation in the distinguishing traits.

Leaves : Opposite along the stems, on petioles less than 1 mm long; blades orbicular to oblong, 3-8 mm long, with a strongly asymmetric base and entire margins, often with a red blotch in the center; stipules united into a membranous, white, triangular or ovate scale, about 1 mm long. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In E. albomarginata, the cyathia (modified flowers) are solitary in the leaf axils. Involucres are bell-shaped, and 1 mm high, and glabrous, with 4 green-yellow to red oblong glands around the edge, each with a conspicuous white to pink petaloid appendage which often has a toothed edge; 15-30 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsule 3-chambered, broadly ovoid, 2 mm long, glabrous, the angles acute; seeds 4-sided, oblong, smooth and whitish, 1-2 mm long. Ecology : Found in open, sandy or gravelly dry places up through the pinon-juniper zone, from 1,000-7,000 ft (305-2135 m); flowers April-September. Distribution : s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, NM, TX, OK; south to c MEX. Notes : This species belongs to the Chamaesyce subgenus of Euphorbia. Some treatments, even recent ones, treat Chamaesyce as a separate genus even though molecular evidence places it within Euphorbia. Chamaesyce spp are distinct based on their leaves which are always opposite and and often have asymmetric bases; cyathia (flower structures) in leaf axils, not at branch tips, and usually with petaloid appendages; and stipules present and not gland-like. E. albomarginata is a common and widespread species in the west, distinguished by being a prostrate perennial without any hairs on the stems, leaves, or seed pods; the cyathia (modified flowers) with large white petaloid appendages (look like petals); and stipules that unite to form a white papery scale between the leaf pairs where they attach to the stem (in other species there is a separate stipule at the base of each petiole). The FNA treatment states that the leaves have white margins (hence the specific epithet) but this trait is not particularly obvious on most specimens. It is wise to make a collection whenever ID to species is needed, as Chamaesyces are difficult to identify in the field, and multiple species of the genus will commonly grow side-by-side. Ethnobotany : Diegueno brew plant into tea to treat sores. Shoshoni and Kawaitsu use leaves and flowers for snakebite. Keres treat eye problems by rub from plant. Navajo use slow tea from whole plant for colds or stomachaches.

216,Euphorbia,setiloba,,,"Kearney and Peebles 1969, McDougall 1973, FNA 2012, Allred and Ivey 2012 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual herb from a slender taproot; stems mostly prostrate and spreading, to 15 cm long; herbage covered with glistening gland-tipped hairs. Leaves : Opposite along the stems, on petioles 1 mm long; blade oblong to ovate, 2-7 mm long, with an asymmetric base and entire margins; stipules distinct, filiform. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In E. setiloba, the cyathia (flower structures) are solitary in the leaf axils near branch tips. Involucres are bell-shaped or urn-shaped, 1 mm high, and villous (hairy), with 4 red to pink glands around the edge, each with a white to pink petaloid appendage that is divided into 3-6 point-tipped triangular segments; 3-7 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsules globose and sharply angled, 1 mm diameter, pubescent; containing 3 tan to cream colored quadrangular seeds, to 1 mm long, dimpled or with faint ridges. Ecology : Found in canyons and on plains from 200-5,000 ft (61-1524 m); flowers March-October. Distribution : c and s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, s NM, s TX; south to n MEX. Notes : This species belongs to the Chamaesyce subgenus of Euphorbia. Some treatments, even recent ones, continue to treat Chamaesyce as a separate genus even though molecular evidence places it within Euphorbia. Chamaesyce spp are distinct based on their leaves which are always opposite and and often have asymmetric bases; cyathia (flower structures) in leaf axils, not at branch tips, and usually with petaloid appendages; and stipules present and not gland-like. E. setiloba is a prostrate (ground-hugging) annual, distinguished by its leaves and stems with long, soft hairs which are usually gland-tipped and somewhat sticky (use your hand lens); small leaves less than 1.5 cm long with smooth edges; cyathia (flower structures) with red glands and white petaloid appendages which are divided into sharp-pointed triangular segments, making them resemble stars; and hairy seed pods. It is wise to make a collection whenever ID to species is needed, as Chamaesyces are difficult to identify in the field, and multiple species of the genus will commonly grow side-by-side. Ethnobotany : Unknown Etymology : Euphorbia is named for Euphorbus, Greek physician of Juba II, King of Mauretania; setiloba means bristle-lobed; alluding to the sharp-pointed petaloid appendages.

Leaves : Opposite, on slender petioles, 1-3 mm long; blades ovate to elliptic or sometimes rhomboidal-ovate, 5-10 mm long and 2-6 mm wide, with entire or minutely denticulate margins; upper surface dark green and lower surface paler, somewhat veiny, finely punctate-glandular. Flowers : Blue-purple or pinkish, in few-flowered verticels at leaf axils, each flower on a pedicel 1-5 mm long; calyx tube mostly 2-3 mm long, finely ribbed and hispidulous, distinctly swollen near the base at maturity; calyx teeth reddish, the upper three ovate-subulate, 1 mm long, slightly curved outward, and the lower pair narrowly subulate, 2 mm long, curved inward; corolla bilabiate, rose-purple, often with darker spots and streaks in lower lip, the corolla tube about equaling the calyx length, hispidulous on the outside. Fruits : Nutlets 4, oblong, 1 mm long, brown. Ecology : Found in rock crevices, rocky slopes, exposed ridges, and at the base of rocks, including limestone, from 500-7,500 ft (152-2286 m); flowers March-October. Distribution : s CA, s UT, AZ, NM, s TX; south to c MEX. Notes : H. nana is a highly variable species and often is hard to tell apart from other Hedeoma spp. Distinguished by being an erect perennial, often with many stems from the base forming loose to dense bunches; the foliage has little to no smell of mint; the leaves are untoothed and broadly elliptical to ovate; and the calyx teeth are spreading at maturity with the upper teeth reflexed, making the calyx bilabiate wih hairs not protruding between calyx teeth. Similar to H. drummondii but that speces has a peppermint smell and the calyx narrows considerably toward the apex, with the teeth converging when in fruit. There are three subspecies with overlapping distribution. The base description generally fits for subsp. nana which is the most widespread and common. Subsp. californica is often found on limestone outcrops and can be distinguished by its closely tufted (bunched) stems which are sparingly hairy near the tips and nearly hairless near the base; small leaves about 5 mm long; and deciduous basal leaves . Ssp. macrocalyx is told apart from subsp. nana by having persistent basal leaves that are 10-15 mm long and purplish beneath; a larger calyx tube 3.5-4.5 mm long, and a corolla tube 5-6 mm long, with the limb (wider 2-lipped part of the corolla) distinctly exceeding the calyx. Ethnobotany : Used ceremonially; taken as a cathartic; taken for indigestion; made into tea; the leaves were used as flavoring; and used as a hair and body wash. Etymology : Hedeoma is from the Greek hedus, sweet, and osme, odor, an ancient name for a strongly aromatic mint; nana comes from the Greek nannos, dwarf.

Glinus radiatus is considered native to tropical and subtropical areas in the New World, although it is doubtfully native in North America. While it is unclear whether the species is native in Louisiana, where it is most common, it is undoubtedly introduced in Arizona (M. A. Lane and D. J. Keil 1976) and California (M. H. Grayum and D. L. Koutnik 1982). In Louisiana, Glinus radiatus occurs in the same habitat as G. lotoides , and the two species grow together in some populations. Some evidence of intermediates in those populations indicates hybrids may form between the two species, but this needs further investigation. Glinus radiatus and G. lotoides are most easily distinguished by seed characteristics (J. W. Thieret 1966b).","JANAS 30(2) STEMS : to 35 em long. LEAVES to 20 mm long, to 12 mm wide.

Its congener, G. lotoides, is even more rare in Arizona, known only from one stock tank at Cabeza Prieta Wildlife Refuge. The two species are best distunguished by their seeds, with G. radiatus having reticulate seeds with arils (white appendages), and G. lotoides having tuberculate seeds that lack arils. G. radiatus superficially resembles some other, more common prostrate desert weeds such as Boerhavia coccinea and Trianthema portulacastrum.

Boerhavia erecta occasionally forms mixed populations with B. intermedia without apparent intergradation. Rarely, some specimens seem to combine features of either species, particularly with regard to inflorescence structure. This is especially so in Sonora, Mexico, and in parts of the Sonoran Desert in Arizona. The two species bloom simultaneously and are visited by small insects. Given the presumed close relationship and weedy habitats of each, hybridization seems possible. Usually, the two species can be distinguished by the differences in fruit length, the appearance of a crownlike apex of the nearly mature fruits of B. erecta (apex of ridges slightly expanded, apex of fruit slightly conic), and the more precisely constructed terminal umbels of B. intermedia . Both species, particularly B. intermedia , may produce entire inflorescences with branches terminating in single flowers. R. E. Woodson Jr. and H. J.

 of coastal conditions and will grow as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia. Bothriochloa barbinodis has been confused with three other species in the Flora region. It 
 differs from B. wrightii in not 
 having glaucous foliage, and in having oblong to merely somewhat fan-shaped 
 panicles with pedicellate spikelets that are definitely shorter than the sessile 
 spikelets; from B. alta in having shorter 
 culms, panicles, and nodal hairs; and from B.

Notes : B. aristidoides is one of the most widespread and abundant annual grasses in the region. Look for a small delicate annual grass with few-flowered panicles superficially resembling a three-awn (Aristida). As a genus, Bouteloua  is characterized by its memorable panicles, which are comprised of one to many solitary, spikelike branches. Each of these spikelike branches has 2 rows of sessile spikelets all pointing the same direction, often giving the branch a one-sided, comblike appearance. Spikelets have 1-2 or occasionally 3 florets each, but only the basal floret is bisexual; distal florets are sterile or staminate. B. aristidoides is unusual in the genus in that it has so few flowers on each spikelike branch that without magnification, each branch appears to be a single spikelet. The 3-awned structures that give the species its name emerge from the rudimentary upper florets of the spikelets. Two varieties are known in the region: var. aristidoides and var. arizonica. They are distinguished by the former having branches with only 2-5 spikelets per branch, with the axis extending 6-10 mm beyond the terminal spikelet; the latter has branches with 6-10 spikelets and the axis only extends 2-5 mm beyond the terminal spikelet.

 portion of their range the differences between the two varieties are less evident, 
 particularly on herbarium specimens. The third variety, B. barbata var. sonorae (Griffiths) Gould, is usually stoloniferous; it is known only 
 from the states of Sonora and Sinola, Mexico. Bouteloua barbata is often confused with juvenile plants

Notes : Distinctive among the Bouteloua with its purplish 3-awned lemmas; the spikelets are usually pectinate (arranged like the teeth of a comb) in classic Bouteloua fashion, but can appear appressed instead making it resemble an Aristida; additionally, young plants can look similar to the small annual Bouteloua barbata. There is a single variety in Arizona: var. trifida. This variety is found throughout the species- range and is distinguished by its lower lemmas being glabrous or sparsely appressed-pubescent on both sides of the veins, with awns 4-6.6 mm long and anthers 0.3-0.4 mm long.  Var. burkii, found only in s NM, s TX, and adjacent MEX, has densely appressed-pubescent lower lemmas and shorter awns, 2-4.5 mm long.

demonstrated that, like Bromus carinatus , B. arizonicus obtained three of its genomes from B. catharticus -or a close relative, but the remaining three
genomes are not homologous with those in B. carinatus , probably being
derived from a species in a section other than Ceratochloa . The small

 winged, pubescent, margins usually less densely pubescent; anthers dehiscent 
 at maturity; paleas glabrous. 2 n = 18, 36. Cynodon dactylon is a variable species, but taxonomists disagree on just 
 how variable. Caro and Sánchez (1969) limited C. dactylon to plants 
 with conduplicate leaves, placing those with convolute leaves in a number of 
 other species, such as C. affinis Caro & Sánchez and C. aristiglumis Caro & Sánchez; de Wet and Harlan (1970) do not mention this character 
 in their study of Cynodon. Caro and Sánchez also employed several 
 other characters in the key separating C. dactylon from the species with 
 convolute immature leaves, but the overlap between the two sides of the lead 
 is substantial. Pending further study, the broader interpretation, in which C. dactylon includes plants with both convolute and conduplicate leaves, 
 has been adopted. Several varieties of C. dactylon have been described, 
 in addition to which numerous cultivars have been developed, some as turf grasses 
 for lawns or putting greens, others as pasture or forage grasses. Their useful 
 range is limited because C. dactylon is not cold hardy, going dormant 
 and turning brown when nighttime temperatures fall below freezing or average 
 daytime temperatures are below 10° C. The most commonly encountered variety, both in the Flora region and in other parts of the world, is C. 
 dactylon var. dactylon , largely because it thrives in severely 
 disturbed, exposed sites; it does not invade natural grasslands or forests. 
 Determining how many other varieties are established in the Flora region 
 is almost impossible, because there has been no global study of variation in 
 the species. The presence of numerous cultivars complicates an already difficult 
 problem. The two varieties keyed out below are the only two that grow in the Flora region according to de Wet and Harlan (1970), but these authors 
 do not appear to have considered the taxa recognized by Caro and Sánchez 
 (1969). For most purposes, it is probably neither necessary nor feasible to 
 identify the variety of C. dactylon encountered. Cynodon dactylon is considered a weed in many countries 
 and it is true that, once established, it is difficult to eradicate. It does, 
 however, have some redeeming values. It is rich in vitamin C, and its leaves 
 are sometimes used for an herbal tea. It is claimed to have various medicinal 
 properties, but these have not been verified. It is considered a good pasture 
 grass, in addition to which it is sometimes grown as an ornamental and for erosion 
 control on exposed soils.",,"FNA 2003, Gould 1988 Common Name : Bermudagrass Duration : Perennial Nativity : Non-Native Lifeform : Graminoid General : Perennial with stolons and rhizomes, stems mostly creeping and stoloniferous with short internodes, forming extensive mats.

Another widespread weed, Chloris virgata, has a similar digitate inflorescence. However C. virgata is an annual grass with awned spikelets, while C. dactylon is perennial and awnless. Ethnobotany : In India, juice pressed from the leaves, seeds, and flowers is mixed with sugar and taken for nausea. Etymology : Cynodon is from Greek meaning dog-s tooth, a traditional common name for the grass in Europe; and dactylon is from Greek daktylos, or finger, referring to the digitate inflorescence.

Ecology : Dry, rocky slopes and flats below 6,000 ft (1829 m); flowers summer and fall. Distribution : c to s CA, east to c CO, south through most of AZ, NM, w TX; south to c MEX. Notes : Dasyochloa is a monotypic genus (one species) endemic to North America. It is especially common  and can be a dominant in southwest deserts. It is a fairly distinct dwarf bunchgrass to 15 cm tall, often with long, stiff, sometimes arching runners producing new plants, sometimes in mid air; the densely packed panicles are subtended by leafy bracts and spikelets are dense with hairs which can appear to be bursting from inflorescences. The tufts of hairs can give the tops of plants a white, snowy appearance, especially late in the season. Early season new leaves are often covered with white cobwebby fluff which easily falls off. One of the most hardy of the small perennial grasses, it responds to very little rainfall and is often found on overgrazed or denuded soils. Munroa squarrosa has a similar dwarf tufted growth form with elevated clusters of leaves and spikelets; however, M. squarrosa lacks the wooly tufts of hairs in the spikelets, and it is annual while D. pulchella is perennial. Ethnobotany : Havasupai used a decoction of the leaves as a laxative. Etymology : Dasyochloa is from the Greek dasys, shaggy, and chloa, grass, referring to the wooly spikelets; pulchella is derived from the Latin for beautiful.

 It is adventive and weedy in North America, growing in low-lying, damp to wet, 
 disturbed areas, including rice fields. The unbranched, rather widely-spaced 
 panicle branches make this one of the easier species of Echinochloa to 
 recognize. Hitchcock (1913) considered that colonum was a non-declining 
 contraction, but dictionaries of Linnaeus' time treated it as a declining
adjective. Because Linnaeus was the first to name the species (as Panicum
colonum ), 
 it seems best to follow the practice considered correct in his day; hence E.

Notes : Eragrostis species have branched inflorescences (panicles), multiple, bisexual flowers (florets) per spikelet and components of the spikelets are for the most part hairless and awnless. E. lehmanniana is a perennial bunchgrass distinguished by its erect to ascending habit, new shoots (innovations) which are produced at lower nodes, panicles 7-18 cm long and 2-8 cm wide (16-40 cm long in E. curvula), and blades 2-12 cm long (12-50 cm long in curvula). The spikelets appear more long and slender when compared with other species of the region, being 5-12 mm long and 0.8-1.2 mm wide (1.5-2 mm wide in E. curvula). One of the most charismatic of the African introductions from earlier in the century, it was used as an erosion control and range revegetation plant, but now it is changing fire-regimes and altering greater areas every year, often the first and sometimes only grass greening up in the landscape. It can dominate landscapes in some areas, with few other plants interspersed as it tends to crowd out native species.

Notes : The genus Panicum is defined as having unawned spikelets with 2 florets, the first floret sterile or staminate, and the second floret bisexual with a rigid lemma that clasps the palea. P. hirticaule is an erect to decumbent annual with broad, flat leaves; a panicle that is about  <1/3 of the stem length; an acute 1st glume (see illustration) and spikelets, <4 mm long. Like many of the annual Panicum spp. in AZ, this species was once classified as a variety of P. capillare (Gould 1951). It is distinguished from P. capillare by its shorter pedicels < 8 mm long and its panicle branches that tend to be more stiff, straight, and ascending rather than gently curving and widely diverging as in P. capillare. FNA recognizes 3 varieties, all found in the Southwest.

Distribution : Native to Africa, w Asia, and India; introduced throughout the warmer, drier regions of the world including the sw US from CA to TX. Notes : This plant is said to be rapidly altering the fire regime of the Sonoran Desert by increasing the fine fuel load and having the ability to resprout after fire more quickly than many native plants. This is causing enormous concern from land managers and environmentalists, and extensive control and removal efforts are underway in southern Arizona. The species was introduced by the US Soil Conservation Service to rehabilitate overgrazed rangeland, and was still being seeded in the southwestern US into the 1980s. The Mexicans continue to seed depleted rangeland with this species. Technicians and volunteers spraying herbicide or digging up this plant are often instructed to look for the naked zig-zag rachis to help with identification during the off-season; however, it is important to be aware that other grass genera have zig-zag rachises, specifically the native Hilaria spp. (AKA Pleuraphis spp., commonly known as galleta grass, tobosa grass, and curly mesquite grass). Killers of buffelgrass should familiarize themselves with these native grasses, which have naked rachises that are more deeply zig-zagging than buffelgrass, and never have any bristles clinging to the inflorescences. Ethnobotany : A commonly used forage crop throughout the warmer regions of the world. Etymology : Pennisetum comes from Latin penna for feather and seta for bristle; ciliare means edged with hairs.

Vegetative : Sheaths glabrous, puberulent across the collar; ligules membranous, truncate, ciliate 1.5-3 mm long; blades large, flat, 4-15 mm broad, 20-50 cm long, margins white, midvein white and prominent. Inflorescence : Panicle usually large, densely flowered, variable, mostly 15-35 cm long; spikelets and pedicels more or less hirsute; As is characteristic of the the grass tribe Andropogonae, S. halepense has spikelets arranged in pairs: one spikelet is sessile and bisexual and the other is pedicelled and staminate. In this species, disarticulation is usually beneath the sessile spikelets, but sometimes also beneath the pedicellate spikelets. Sessile spikelets are 4-6 mm long, with 2 florets, the first sterile and reduced to a hyaline lemma, and the second fertile.

Distribution : Native to the Mediterranean and naturalized around the world in warm-temperate regions.  Found in Ontario and every state in the US, south to South America. Notes : A robust perennial grass distinguished by being rhizomotous and tall, up to 2 m; with ciliate ligules, and pyramidal, open inflorescences bearing pedicillate-sessile spikelet pairs which are hairy and have twisted awns. The entire inflorescence usually has a conspicuous reddish color. The species is considered to be highly invasive, and commonly found along irrigation ditches and in floodplains in the Southwest. Johnson grass was historically cultivated for hay and forage but is no longer recommended for planting due to its invasiveness and ability to form stable hybrids with S. bicolor (cultivated sorghum). Also, at certain developmental stages and under some adverse environmental conditions, Johnson grass may form cyanogenetic glycosides that can poison livestock. It also appears to sequester selenium and other elements that are toxic at high doses when growing in soils with high concentrations of those elements, making it potentially useful for mine reclamation.

Achenes light brown to brown, 1.8-2.5 mm, glabrous. Eriogonum fasciculatum is a complex, polyploid series of variants that are generally distinct but often difficult to distinguish morphologically. Variety emphereium Reveal is confined to central Baja California, Mexico. The introduction of Eriogonum fasciculatum as a decorative roadside plant by the California Department of Transportation is resulting in hybrid populations involving E. cinereum . The aggressively weedy and (for Arizona) exotic variety foliosum is rapidly invading the native habitat of var. polifolium . Members of E. fasciculatum are food plants for several butterflies, notably the Bernardino dotted-blue ( Euphilotes bernardino ), lupine blue ( Plebeius lupini ), Mormon metalmark ( Apodemia mormo ), and Behr's metalmark ( A. virgulti ). Probably the butterfly most commonly seen with the species is the nut-brown hairstreak ( Satyrium saepium ), which frequents plants in full flower. Eriogonum fasciculatum is also the most important native source of honey in California. This widespread species was used extensively by Native Americans for a variety of ailments. Its application for pain and headaches (D. P. Barrows 1900; K. Hedges 1986; E. W. Voegelin 1938) was rather common, as was its general use for diarrhea (Hedges; Voegelin). M. L. Zigmond (1981) reported that the Kawaiisu lined their acorn granaries with leaves of var. proliferum to keep out rain-a daunting challenge given the size of the leaves! L. Hinton (1975) reported the use of a decoction of dried flowers and roots to maintain a healthy heart, and M. C. Stevenson (1915) indicated that a powder derived from the roots was used by the Zuñi to treat wounds, whereas a root decoction was taken for colds and hoarseness. B. R. Bocek (1984) reported that the Costanoan Indians of California used a decoction of the plant to treat unspecified urinary problems. F. H. Elmore (1943) reported the use of a decoction of var. proliferum by the Navajo (Diné) people as an anti-witchcraft medicine.",,"Wiggins 1964, Benson and Darrow 1981, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Common Name : Eastern Mojave buckwheat Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Subshrub General : Low spreading woody shrub, 0.5-1 m, compact and much branched with leafy stems and shredding bark; stems, leaves and scapes canescent-pubescent.

The cause of the fistulose stem and inflorescence branches in Eriogonum inflatum was imaginatively attributed by A. M. Stone and C. T. Mason (1979) to the larvae of gall insects. This fallacy continues to appear in the literature. Greenhouse studies have shown that stems of this and some other species of the genus inflate without the presence of any insects. Other researchers have shown that the inflation involves a build-up of CO2 within the stems, which take over as the primary photosynthetic body as leaves wilt or eventually dry up and fall away from the plant (C. D. Osmond et al. 1987). Not all individuals of E. inflatum will have fistulose stems and branches, as this feature is partly a function of available moisture: the drier the conditions, the less pronounced the inflation. Stems produced in the summer tend to be inflated less frequently than those produced in the spring. The 'annual' phase of Eriogonum inflatum is distinct from its truly annual relatives. Its flowering stems and inflorescence branches are distinctly grayish, whereas those of the true annuals are green or yellowish green. As circumscribed here, Eriogonum inflatum occurs in Arizona, southern and east-central California, western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, central and southern Nevada, and southern and eastern Utah. Some Native Americans occasionally ate newly emerged stems of Eriogonum inflatum (S. A. Weber and P. D. Seaman 1985; M. L. Zigmond 1981). The hollow stems were used as drinking tubes (Weber and Seaman) and pipes (E. W. Gifford 1936).

Some of the variation has yet to be fully resolved, especially in the var. nodosum complex where, at least in Mexico, one additional expression remains to be named. A clear distinction between var. subscaposum and E. kennedyi is not possible in southern California (see discussion below). Nearly all of the varieties of E. wrightii are in cultivation, although the most elegant (var. olanchense ) has yet to be so honored. Few ethnobotanical uses of bastard-sage are reported in the literature. L. C. Wyman and S. K. Harris (1951) noted that the Kayenta Navajo use it (var. wrightii ) as an emetic, while M. L. Zigmond (1981) stated that the Kawaiisu used the pounded seeds (probably of var. subscaposum ) in a beverage or as a dry meal. Members of the species are food plants for the rare Rita dotted-blue butterfly ( Euphilotes rita ), the Pacific dotted-blue ( E. enoptes ), the veined blue ( Plebeius neurona ), and the Mormon metalmark ( Apodemia mormo mormo ).",,"FNA 2005 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Subshrub General : Perennial subshrub, shrub, or rarely scapose herb, 15-100 cm tall by 10-150 cm wide, or sometimes matted and less than 30 cm tall; stems spreading to erect, stout to slender, with or without peristent leaf bases; herbage lanate to thinly tomentose or glabrous, grayish to greenish or reddish. Leaves : Almost always clustered in fascicles (sheaths), the fascicles located at the base of the plant and at branch tips, and sometimes along the stems; blades oblanceolate to broadly elliptic, 1-30 mm long by 1-10 mm wide, both surfaces tomentose to floccose, or occasionally the upper surface nearly glabrous. Flowers : White to pink and arranged in clusters of a few short-stalked flowers held together by a cup-shaped structure called an involucre. Involucres arranged in racemes on wand-like branches, or sometimes arranged in cymes (flat-topped inflorescences); each individual flower is 1-4 mm high, with 6 ruffled petal-like tepals, these fused together at the base and white to pink or rose. Fruits : Achenes light brown to brown, 1-3 mm long, glabrous. Ecology : Found in dry, rocky soils on flats and slopes, from 3,000-7,000 ft (914-2134 m); flowers June-October. Distribution : CA, NV, AZ, s UT, NM, s TX; south to n MEX. Notes : A common, low-growing shrub that doesn't resemble many other species. It has thick, dark-brown woody branches at the base and smaller tomentose stems above, which are ascending or spreading and often form dense growth; leaves are gray-green and also covered with dense mats of white hairs; the leaves are in small bunches (fascicles) at the stem nodes; the white flowers arranged along semi-constricted inflorescences, these often erect or tucked into the rest of the foliage The species description encompasses a large amount of variation because there are 9 currently recognized varieties (according to Flora of North America, 2005). There are two varieties in Arizona and New Mexico, var. nodosum and var. wrightii. Var. nodosum is mostly found in the low deserts of southwestern Arizona and southeastern California, and can be told apart by gray-tomentose flowering stems and branches. Var. wrightii is found from southeast California to west Texas and has white-tomentose stems. Ethnobotany : Seeds were pounded into a meal and drunk as a beverage, or even eaten dry; the plant also used as an emetic. Etymology : Eriogonum is from the Greek erion, wool, and gony, knee, alluding to the hairy nodes of the first species described, E. tomentosum; wrightii is named for William Greenwood Wright (1831-1912) a California lepidopterist.

Young plants of Portulaca halimoides in desert areas may exhibit reddish stems and sepals. As the yellow petals fade, the persistent, reddish sepals cover the top of the capsule, giving the false impression of red flowers. Immature seeds are reddish brown to brownish black and may be papillose. Morphologic variability occurs in relation to habitat differences over the range of this species. Desert conditions produce depauperate plants; more robust specimens occur in Central America and South America. The type of P. halimoides is conspecific with P. parvula A. Gray within this context.

P. Simopoulos and N. Salem Jr. (1986) and A. P. Simopoulos et al. (1992) have shown Portulaca oleracea to have the highest content of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants of any green leafy vegetable examined to date, suggesting that common purslane should be considered for its nutritional value and not for its weediness. It has long been used as fodder and may have been present in the New World in pre-Columbian times (R. Byrne and J. H. McAndrews 1975). Currently, it is fed to poultry to reduce egg cholesterol. General Notes : Portulaca oleracea is a highly variable species with worldwide distribution in temperate to warm regions and is the most winter-hardy of all the portulacas. It is a very aggressive weed, one of the ten most noxious weeds worldwide (J. S. Singh and K. P. Singh 1967). As such, many variants have been named (C. D. Legrand 1962) based on seed surface differences, size of seeds, or on variable characters of growth habit, leaf length, and number of stamens. Seven subspecies were recognized by A. Danin et al. (1978): subsp. oleracea, subsp. impolita Danin & H. G. Baker, subsp. granulatostellulata Danin & H. G. Baker, subsp. nicaraguensis Danin & H. G. Baker, subsp. nitida Danin & H. G.

Introduced. Worldwide in temperate to warm regions; throughout the U.S. (including AK) and Canada. Young leaves and stems edible raw or cooked. Portulaca retusa has been previously recognized as a separate species, based on seed morphological characteristics, growth habit, sepal shape, and number of stigmatic branches (Correll & Johnston 1970, W.B. McDougall 1973, Martin & Hutchins 2001, Kearney & Peebles 1960, Welsh et. al. 2003). Positive identification from herbarium specimens is only possible with mature seeds (roundedtuberculate vs. sharply echinate or stellate in P. retusa). Intergradation of seed morphological characteristics between the two species has also been observed. Other characteristics such as growth habit, sepal shape, and number of style lobes, previously thought to distinguish P. retusa from P. oleracea, have been found highly variable (Correll & Johnston 1970, Martin & Hutchins 2001, Kearney & Peebles 1960, Welsh et. al. 2003, W.B. McDougall 1973). More work, especially with fresh intact specimens, is needed to substantiate recognition of P. retusa at the specific level.

Notes : Portulacas in the southwest are small herbs with succulent leaves and stems, can have colorful flowers and possess capsules with few-many subtending leaves. This is the most weedy, widespread, most common species in the genus. It is a spreading annual with succulent, often reddish stems and opposite, succulent, spoon-shaped leaves; the flowers are small and yellow. It likes warm, sunny, open, disturbed areas including the edges of farm fields, irrigation ditches, and roadsides. It is commonly claimed to be non-native, but Flora of North America notes that it may have been present in North America in pre-Columbian times.

For Z. palustris in Europe the mean rostrum length is 0.78 ± 0.20deletion} mm, the mean podogyne length is 0.4 ± 0.19 mm, and the rostrum to fruit ratio is less than 0.5 (W. Van Wierssen Vierssen 1982). North American Zannichellia does not match any of these figures exactly. In North America Zannichellia has been considered historically to comprise only one species, which has been called Z. palustris. Until further research determines the range of Zannichellia and species delimitations, we areI am continuing to consider all North American material to be monospecific and am are applying the name Z. palustris to our that material.",,"Cronquist et al. 1977, FNA 2000, Heil et al. 2013, Martin and Hutchins 1980, Allred and Ivey 2012 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Submersed aquatic annual herb (occasionally perennial); stems 30-50 cm long, filiform, light green but drying tan or brown; roots single or in pairs at stem nodes. Leaves : All leaves are submersed; with alternate, opposite or pseudo-whorled leaf arrangement, often all on same plant; blades filiform, 2-8 cm long, less than 0.5 mm wide. Flowers : Tiny and inconspicuous, in pairs at the leaf axils; each pair consists of one male and one female flower; male flower consists of a single stamen; female flower of 4 or 5 distinct, short-stipitate pistils. Fruits : Single-seeded drupaceous fruits that are obliquely oblong, flattened, 3-4 mm long, dentate on the back. Ecology : Found in streams and in still to slow moving water, even brackish water, from 5,000-9,000 ft in the Southwest; flowers May-November. Distribution : Found throughout the world; in every state in the US. Notes : Depending on the publication date of the text, look for this species under Zanichelliaceae, Potamogetonaceae, or Najadaceae. It is distinguished from other pond weeds based on the leaves being mostly opposite, filiform (thread-like), less than 1 mm diameter, and not clasping the stems at the base nor narrowed to a pedicel; and the flowers and fruits are sessile or on short pedicels only about 1mm long, in the leaf axils. Look for the small fruits, about 3 mm long in the leaf axils, which are asymmetrically oblong and tapered at the tip into a curved beak. There is one species of Zanichellia in North America, and it is found worldwide. Ethnobotany : Unknown Etymology : Zannichellia is named for Italian botanist Gian G.

Sporangia  containing 32 or 64 spores. Astrolepis cochisensis is reported to be toxic to sheep (F. P. Mathews 1945). Three cytotypes that occupy different ranges and/or habitats have been identified and are treated here as subspecies. These include a sexual diploid (subsp. chihuahuensis ) found on calcareous substrates in the Chihuahuan Desert; an apogamous triploid (subsp. cochisensis ), which inhabits primarily calcareous substrates in the Sonoran, Mojavean, and western Chihuahuan deserts; and an apogamous tetraploid (subsp. arizonica ), which occupies primarily noncalcareous substrates in southern Arizona. Isozyme analyses suggest that subsp. cochisensis is an autotriploid derivative of the diploid subsp. chihuahuensis (D. M. Benham 1989). Both the isozymes and substrate preferences of subsp. arizonica indicate, however, that it is not a simple autotetraploid and that other taxa remain to be discovered within the Astrolepis cochisensis complex.",,"FNA 1993, Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Common Name : Cochise scaly cloakfern General : Perennial fern with compact stems, scales tan or somewhat darker near base, to 10 mm, margins ciliate-dentate to entire.

The former might be confused with A . cochisensis on occasion, but the abundance of adaxial scales and the larger pinnae of A . integerrima should serve to distinguish these species.

D. S. Siegler and E. Wollenweber (1983) identified three chemotypes in this species correlated with substrate specificity and subtle variations in farina color. These three 'races' occupy different portions of the geographic range, and further investigation may indicate that they deserve formal taxonomic recognition.

The native status of Oligomeris linifolia in North America has long been controversial; its presence represents the most remarkable disjunction in the family. Recent molecular research (S. Martín-Bravo et al. 2009) strongly suggests that it is native here. Oligomeris linifolia has been reported to be toxic to cattle. Occurrence of this species in Utah is based on the following collection: 'southern Utah,' 1877, E. Palmer 47 (US, WIS). 'Cambess' has appeared in literature as a common name for O. linifolia , apparently resulting from confusion with an abbreviation of the author Cambessèdes. 'Lineleaf whitepuff' has also appeared as a common name for this species; the epithet linifolia should be translated as 'flax-leaved.'",,"Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Erect and strictly or profusely branched from base, 5-40 cm tall.

Ecology : Occasional to common in sandy washes, rare on rocky slopes, grows below 4,500 ft (1372 m); flowers March-May and October-December. Distribution : sw AZ, se CA; nw Sonroa and Baja Calif., MEX Notes : Condalia is a genus of thorny shrubs which are easily recognizable by their spine-tipped branchlets, making it appear that there are leaves growing out of large thorns. Ziziphus obtusifolia is similar, and can be distinguished by its larger berries, 6-8 mm long, and the presence of petals on the flowers (Condalia spp. have sepals but no petals). To tell this species apart from C. mexicana and C. corelleii, look at the spatulate, dull green leaves which are on petioles; and the diffusely branched architechture. Ethnobotany : Papago ate the fruits raw. Etymology : Condalia is named after Antonio Condal, and 18th century Spanish physician and botanist, globosa refers to the globose fruits.

The leaf and branch morphology of Z. obtusifolia is variable. Solitary serrate to crenate ovate leaves with marginal glands on thorn-tipped canescent branchlets are representative of the new growth; older stems have leaves that are entire, oblong, elliptical or linear and are arranged in short shoots. The short shoots may become woody with age. Elongation of the short shoot into new thorn-tipped branches may occur, being evident by a leaf scar. The leaf size is dependent upon climate, habitat and season.

In the desert mountains of western Pima County uncommon apparent hybrids occur between S. arizonica and the closely related S. eremophila. Some of these putative hybrids are sterile with abortive spores, but other plants intermediate for one or more morphological traits produce apparently well-formed spores that are slightly larger than those of either of the parents. These may represent an allopolyploid that should be recognized taxonomically. Where S. arizonica co-occurs with the morphologically distinctive S. rupincola, occasional putative hybrids also are encountered with intermediate morphology and abortive spores.

In Chamaesaracha the calyx remains herbaceous and wraps tightly around the berry. C. coronopus is distinguished from others in the genus by its stems and leaves being sparsely covered with coarse, stellate or branching hairs, never glandular hairs (use your hand lens). C. conoides and C. sordida both have at least some glandular hairs, and lack the branching or stellate hairs. Also, C. sordida has leaves which are entire to only slightly lobed, compared to C. coronopus which usually has distinctly pinnately lobed leaves. Ethnobotany : Used for swellings and ceremonially. Etymology : Chamaesaracha comes from the Greek word chamai, dwarf or false, and the genus Saracha which it resembles and is also in the nightshade family (Solanaceae); coronopous is from Greek korone, crown and pous, foot.

Fruits : Berry ellipsoid to ovoid, bright orange-red, 3-9 mm, juicy, with many seeds. Ecology : Found along arid washes and arroyos, bajadas, rocky slopes, mesas and foothills below 5,500 ft (1676 m); flowers February-May, rarely August-September. Distribution : s and c CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM; south to n MEX. Notes : Distinguished by being a glabrous, thorny erect shrub with light-colored young bark and dark brown older bark (lighter than L. berlandieri); linear-terete, succulent leaves; calyx 1/4 as long as the corolla; corolla >7mm long with hairless lobes, and with hardly-exserted to exserted stamens; and red berries. There are three recognized varieties in the region: var. wrightii with 4-lobed flowers 4-8 mm long and leaves broadly spatulate to obovate; var. andersonii with 4-5 lobed flowers 8-16 mm long and leaves 3-16 mm long, linear-terete to narrowly spatulate; and var. deserticola with 4-5 lobed flowers 8-16 mm long and leaves 20-35 mm long, narrowly spatulate to spatulate.  Some taxonomists do not recognize var. deserticola and var. andersonii as distinct.  Var. andersonii is the most widespread of the three varieties.  If clarity is necessary for the study, take a specimen, preferably with flowers, and  make the determination in the herbarium.  Similar to L. exsertum in stamens with adnate hairy filament bases, but that species differs in its delicate appearance and non-fleshy leaves. Told apart from L. berlandieri by the lighter colored bark. Characters distinguishing L. andersonii in the key are the corolla length (>7 mm); mostly glabrous corolla lobes; the short calyx only 1/4 as long as the flower; and the fact that the plant is overall mostly glabrous (hairless). In AZ the species in found primarily below the Mogollon Rim, on the Arizona Strip, along the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon and the up the Little Colorado River drainage to the Gray Mountain area. Ethnobotany : Berries were eaten fresh and dried, dried for winter use, boiled into mush or ground into flour, or made into a drink. Etymology : Lycium is from Greek name Lykion used to describe a thorny tree or shrub; andersonii is named after  Dr. Charles Lewis Anderson (1827-1910), physician and naturalist, and collector of the type specimen.

Leaves : Alternate, lowermost leaves petioled, elliptic to lance-ovate or ovate, upper leaves becoming sessile and lanceolate, blades 3-18 cm long. Flowers : White or greenish-white and showy, corollas salverform with narrow throats and 5 rounded lobes, glabrous or sparsely pubescent, the tube 15-20 mm long, the limb 8-10 mm wide, calyxes 8-10 mm long with 4 very unequal, linear lobes, stamens unequal, filaments attached below the middle of the corolla tube, infloresences subtended by linear to lanceolate bracts bracts to 30 mm long. Fruits : Capsule 4-6 mm long with 2-5 chambers, the calyx enlarging to incompletely surround the fruit at maturity. Seeds many, minute, with angled edges. Ecology : Found in sandy washes, in scrub communities, to 1,500 ft (457 m); flowering February-June. Distribution : Arizona, California; Mexico. Notes : The showy white campanulate flowers with rounded lobes and narrow throats, conspicuously unequal, linear-lanceolate calyx lobes, annual duration, and glandular-pubescent herbage help to distinguish this species. Jepson notes this genus is extremely toxic to cattle. Look for this species in western Arizona, noted by Kearney and Peebles to be frequent in southern Yuma county. Distinguished from N. attenuata by the calyx lobes with are narrower and not all the same length within a calyx. (triangular and all the same length in N. attenuata)the stem leaves mostly sessile (mostly on petioles in N. attenuata) and corollas 1-2 cm long (2-4 cm in N. attenuata). N. obtusifolia is common in the low elevation deserts; it is distinguished by its leaves which are clasp the stem, and its hairy corollas (corollas glabrous or very sparsely pubescent in this species). Ethnobotany : Infusion of leaves used as an emetic, poultice of leaves applied to cuts, bruises, swellings and other wounds, leaf smoke blown into the ear and covered with a warm pad for earaches, also leaves chewed, smoked or used in a drinkable decoction, and plants used by shamans to control rain, increase crop production, divining and to improve health of community or to drive away malevolent powers, leaves smoked as part of a hunting ritual or by travelers to clear away all danger and ensure blessing from spiritual guides. Etymology : Nicotiana is named for Jean Nicot (1530-1600), French ambassador to Portugal and the person supposedly responsible for introducing tobacco into France about 1560, also author of one of the first French language dictionaries, and clevelandii is named after Daniel Cleveland (1838-1929), an authority on ferns, lawyer, and botanical collector, who during the course of his collecting, rediscovered all the plants of the San Diego area that had been found only once.

Typha domingensis aggressively invades and forms nearly pure stands in brackish or nutrient-enriched wetlands in the Florida Everglades and elsewhere. It is established but does not mature fruits on the cold coast of northern California. There are specimens of putative hybrids with T. angustifolia beyond the main range of T. domingensis, in southeastern and northwestern Nebraska and southeastern Kentucky, and with T. latifolia in southeastern Nebraska. Vegetative T. domingensis or hybrids occur on the Atlantic Coast north as far as Delaware. (S. G. Smith, unpublished). The northern Illinois locality is a power plant cooling pond. The Wyoming record is from a hot spring and may be a hybrid with T. latifolia. Typha domingensis probably should be treated as a highly variable pantropic and warm temperate species, occurring to 40º E north and south latitude worldwide, and needing study to determine infraspecific taxa and delimitation from related species (B.

Inflorescences axillary glomerules, green. Bracts of pistillate flowers narrow, thin, 1.5-5 mm, ± equaling or slightly exceeding tepals. Pistillate flowers: tepals (3-)4-5, narrowly ovate to broadly linear, unequal or subequal, 1.5-3 mm, thin, apex acute or acuminate; style branches spreading; stigmas 3. Staminate flowers intermixed with pistillate; tepals 3(-4); stamens 3. Utricles broadly ovoid, 1.7-2.5 mm, equaling tepals, mostly smooth (slightly verrucose or rugose in dry plants), dehiscence regularly circumscissile. Seeds black, lenticular to broadly plumply lenticular, 1.3-1.6 mm diam., rather dull. Flowering summer-fall. Disturbed habitats: roadsides, riverbanks, railroads, fields, waste places, sandy flats; 0-2200 m; Alta., B.C., Man., Ont., Que., Sask.; Ala., Alaska, Ariz., Ark., Calif., Colo., Conn., Del., D.C., Fla., Ga., Idaho, Ill., Ind., Iowa, Kans., Ky., La., Maine, Md., Mass., Mich., Minn., Mo., Mont., Nebr., Nev., N.H., N.J., N.Mex., N.Y., N.Dak., Ohio, Okla., Oreg., Pa., R.I., S.C., S.Dak., Tenn., Tex., Utah, Vt., Va., Wash., W.Va., Wis., Wyo.; introduced and often completely naturalized in South America, Eurasia, and other regions. The name Amaranthus graecizans often has been misapplied to both A. blitoides and A. albus in older North American floras and manuals. Amaranthus blitoides was probably originally native to central and partly eastern United States, but now it is widely and successfully naturalized almost everywhere in temperate North America and in many subtropical to warm-temperate regions. It has not been reported from Mississippi or North Carolina but since it is found in all other conterminous United States it can be expected to occur in these two as well. Varieties have been described within Amaranthus blitoides ; most of them are of no taxonomic significance, being mostly ecologic forms or local morphologic variants. Among the infraspecific taxa, the most constant is var. reverchonii Uline & W. L.

Distribution : Originally native to the mid-west and eastern US, now widely naturalized.  Found throughout the intermountain western United States and from Mexico to Canada. Notes : This species can be recognized by its prostrate, spreading growth form; oval-shaped leaves with entire margins (edges that are smooth and without lobes or teeth) which taper down to a slender petiole; and the small clusters of green flowers which grow only in the leaf axils and do not form inflorescences at the branch tips. Stems are often but not always reddish in color and usually appear somewhat succulent.

Originally a riverside pioneer in eastern North America, now Amaranthus hybridus is extremely abundant in agricultural fields and other disturbed habitats. Related cultivated species have been reported from the flora area, including A. caudatus, A. hypochondriacus , and A. cruentus ; there is no evidence that they are established; specimens identified as these species are often variants of A. hybridus . Distribution of Amaranthus hybridus in North America needs clarification because the name was misapplied to other species, notably A. powellii, and specimens of A. retroflexus, A. powellii, and A. hybridus are frequently interchangeably misidentified. Forms of A. hybridus and A. powellii with reddish inflorescences are often misidentified as escaped and hence presumably naturalized, cultivated species A. caudatus Linnaeus, A. hypochondriacus Linnaeus, and A. cruentus Linnaeus. Amaranthus hybridus is extremely variable. In particular, there are numerous North American specimens with subobtuse tepals and thick inflorescences, suggesting hybridization with A. retroflexus . In Europe such presumably hybrid forms are known as A. × ozanonii Thellung (A. Thellung 1914-1919). A new, presumably hybridogenous taxon, Amaranthus × tucsonensis Henrickson, was recently described from Arizona (J. Henrickson 1999). It was suggested that one of its parents is A. hybridus ; the other parental species (probably a species with obtuse or spatulate tepals) remains unknown.

Leaves : Alternate and petiolate, the petioles shorter than or equal to the blade; blades ovate to lanceolate, 4-15 cm long, 2-6 cm wide, dark green, thin and soft, with entire margins, cuneate bases, and mucronate tips. Flowers : Small, greenish, red, purple, or rarely white or yellowish, in robust axillary and terminal spikes, the terminal spikes longer than the axillary and with numerous shorter branches at the base.

Distribution : Widespread across much of the United States. FNA notes that the distribution of Amaranthus hybridus in North America needs clarification because the name was misapplied to other species. Notes : Regularly confused with the quite similar A. powellii. Both species are monoeceous (male and female flowers on the same plant) annuals with ovate-lanceolate leaves and axillary and terminal inflorescences. The key differences are that A powellii has stiff, stout, erect inflorescences  with bracts 4-7 mm; A. hybridus has narrower, soft, lax inflorescences with spreading branches (when branches are present) and bracts 2-4 mm. Also appears similar to A. palmeri, but that species is dioeceous (male and female flowers on separate branches) and has only terminal inflorescences. A. palmeri sometimes has glomerules of flowers in the leaf axils, but these are quite small and certainly do not constitute an entire inflorescence, as is found in the leaf axils of A. powellii and A. hybridus.

Etymology : Atriplex is the ancient Latin name for saltbush, derived from the plant-s Greek name atraphaxes; hymenelytra makes reference to Hymen, the Greek god of marriage often used to note a pairing, and elytron, a sheath or covering, probably referring to the paired fruiting bracteoles surrounding the seed.

Wide-ranging both ecologically and geographically from rim rock, rocky ledges and slopes to canyon bottoms in the deserts, grasslands, chaparral, Madrean woodlands, pinyonjuniper woodlands, ponderosa pine forests, and riparian zones: all AZ cos.; 500-2275 m (1500-7500 ft); Mar-May; w U.S. Material from the w U.S. including AZ has been recognized as Rhus aromatica Aiton var. trilobata (Nutt.) A. Gray, differing in its sparsely pubescent fruits from typical R. aromatica of the e U.S. with villous fruits (Fernald 1941); also, R. aromatica var. trilobata is ill-scented whereas R. aromatica of the e U.S. has a pleasant citrus scent (David Hammond pers. comm.). Several other varieties of Rhus aromatica have been named (based on characters such as leaf size, lobing, and pubescence, and time of flowering) that would occur in AZ (Barkley 1937). Since there are no consistent geographic patterns to the variation in these characters, Rhus aromatica are best treated as a polymorphic species consisting of only the two varieties (e U.S. and w U.S.).

Leaves : Alternate, ternately compound or simple; leaflets 1-5 cm long, usualy 3-lobed, margins coarsely toothed; shiny, dark green above, paler green beneath, glabrous or puberulent on one or both sides, turning red in fall. Flowers : Inflorescence lateral, arising from twigs of the previous years; flowers in dense, spikelike clusters, 1-1.5 cm long; flowers sessile, appearing before the leaves; sepals 5, pinkish; petals 5, yellow, 2-3 mm long. Fruits : Drupes crowded in clusters; reddish-orange, rounded, 5-8 mm diameter, covered with short, sticky, red hairs. Ecology : Dry hillsides, canyons, and mesas from 2,500-7,500 ft (762-2286 m); flowers March-June. Distribution : Most of N.America; from Alberta, CAN, south to s CA, east to MD; south to s MEX. Notes : A widespread shrub of many biotic communities and habitats; distinguished by being usually 1-2 m tall often with soft, velvety pubescence on stems and leaves (sometimes sparsely-haired); pungent-smelling foliage due to glands all over (hence the common name ""skunk bush""); trifoliate leaves with round-lobed leaflets; and clusters of bright red berries that taste like lemons. There is uncertainty surrounding this species. Anderson 2007 suggested that all species of our regional R. trilobata and its varieties be subsumed under R. aromatica. Anderson treated the species as polymorphic, suggesting our western specimens (which he calls R. aromatica var. trilobata) differed from those in the East (R. aromatica) by their sparsely pubescent fruits. He indicated several previously named varieties of this species that lack consistent geographic patterns, and advised they be treated as one complex. Allred and Ivey (2012) continue to use the name R. trilobata and recognize 6 varieties in New Mexico, while acknowledging that the varieties are ill-defined and perhaps not worth recognizing. Ethnobotany : Leaves are chewed to alleviate stomachache. Oil from fruit is used to treat hair loss. Wild and tended forms very different, so that tended shrubs have long, straight shoots used in basketry. Fruit sour but edible, often mixed with water for a refreshing beverage. Also ground into a meal, after drying in the sun. Fruits, leaves, and bark used in making dye. Navajo used it to treat skin problems and stomach problems.  Different parts are used for dying wool and baskets. Etymology : Rhus is derived from rhous, an ancient Greek name for Sumac, while trilobata means three-lobed.

Notes : Physaria species (until recently classified as Lesquerella) have gray-green leaves, often with stellate hairs; white or yellow 4-petaled flowers; and round, globe-shaped fruits with a persistent style attached to the tip. P. gordonii distinguished by being an annual (occasionally short-lived perennial) with dense stellate hairs; the stems are often decumbent (growing horizontally along the ground, with the tip of the stem turning upward and ascending); with cauline leaves often pointing upward and overlapping; flowers with showy yellow petals; and seed pods on mostly horizontal, s-shaped stalks. One of the important key couplets in the Lesquerella group has to do with whether or not the rays of the stellate hairs are fused to each other. P. gordonii leaves have stellate hairs with fewer than 10 rays, and the rays are not fused to each other, with some of the rays forking into more than one branch. This can be difficult to see without a dissecting scope, so try to collect as much of the plant as possible for proper determination.

Steinmann and R. S. Felger (1997), Bernardia incana is readily distinguished from B. myricifolia, with which it has often been merged (for example, G. L. Webster 1993b), by its dark persistent stipules that are thickened by a dried, resinous exudate. Within the flora area, B. incana occupies a mostly montane Sonoran Desert range in southern Arizona and California (extending just into the southern Mojave Desert), with outlying populations in the Grand Canyon.

Leaves mostly in basal 1 /2 of plant; larger leaves with petiole 7-25 mm, blade broadly ovate or oval to lanceolate, 20-45 × 7-16 mm (distal leaves smaller, sometimes longer, proportionately narrower), adaxial surface usually glabrous, occasionally glandular-puberulent, often minutely punctate, abaxial surface paler than adaxial, glabrous or glabrate, usually punctate with small patches of reddish or brownish cells, base round, obtuse, or truncate, margins entire or slightly sinuate, apex acute, obtuse, or round. Inflorescences terminal, forked ca. 3-6 times ± evenly (or clearly unevenly), diffuse, usually with sticky internodal bands; branches strongly ascending, terminating in umbels or flowers borne singly, occasionally subumbellate (all pedicels not attaching at same point), rarely irregularly compound umbels. Flowers: pedicel 0.5-3.2 mm; bracts at base of perianth quickly deciduous, (1-)2, narrowly lance-acuminate, 0.5-1 mm; perianth whitish to pale pink or purplish, campanulate distal to constriction, 0.7-1.2[-2] mm; stamens 2-3, included or barely exserted. Fruits 1-15 per cluster, straw colored or gray-brown, obconic, broadly low conic, 2-2.8(-3.2) × 0.7-1.3 mm (l/w: 1.7-3.2), apex nearly truncate, glabrous; ribs (4-)5, acute, slightly rugose or undulate near sulci; sulci 0.2-1 times as wide as base of ribs, coarsely transversely rugose, smooth or very faintly papillate. 2 n = 52, ca. 54. Flowering summer-late fall. Sandy or gravelly areas in deserts and arid grasslands, disturbed areas; [0-]100-1700 m; Ariz., Calif., Nev., N.Mex., Tex.; Mexico (Baja California, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Sonora). Boerhavia intermedia is a wide-ranging and variable species of the arid areas of southwestern North America. Ordinarily, the terminal inflorescence is an umbel of at least a few flowers. Plants with few-flowered umbels often have only one flower at some of the terminal inflorescences. Plants with predominantly or entirely one-flowered terminal inflorescences occasionally occur in the eastern part of the range. To the west, and especially on the Coloradan portion of the Sonoran Desert and on the Baja California peninsula, plants with one-flowered terminal inflorescences are more frequent, and even though those have five-ribbed fruits, they often have been identified as B. triquetra . In that region, such plants may have proportionately broader fruits as the ribs become more winglike. Some plants in southern California bear a few fruits with four angles, and in this respect are intermediate to B. triquetra .",,"FNA 2003, Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969, McDougall 1973 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual herb, 20-60 cm tall, from a taproot; stems erect or ascending to occasionally decumbent, moderately or profusely branched primarily near top; herbage covered with bent, minute hairs, especially near base of plant. Leaves : Opposite, on petioles shorter than the blades, with the leaves concentrated toward the lower half of the plant; blades thick and fleshy, 4-5 cm long and 1-5 cm wide, broadly oblong to ovate-lanceolate, with smooth or slightly sinuate margins; leaf surfaces glaucous, especially the undersides; both surfaces often brown-punctate. Flowers : Pink, in umbellate clusters of a few flowers, the clusters arranged in diffuse panicles with ascending branches that fork 3-6 times, with sticky bands on the branches and pedicels; sepals appearing petal-like, about 1 mm long, whitish to pale pink or purplish, and fused into a bell-shape; petals absent. Fruits : Achenes straw-colored or gray-brown, 2-3 mm long and 1 mm wide, obconic and flattened at the tip, glabrous. Ecology : Found in sandy soils, from 1,000-4,500 ft (305-1372 m); flowers July-September. Distribution : s CA, s NV, AZ, NM, s TX; south to n MEX. Notes : A wide-ranging and variable species. Usually the inflorescence is composed of small umbels of at least a few flowers, with equal-lengthed pedicels emerging from a single point on on the branchlet; however, in the lower deserts of the Southwest, flowers at the branch tips are often solitary rather than clustered. B. erects is quite similar but that species often tends to be taller, over 0.5 m tall, and if you look closely you'll see that the clusters of flowers are not truly umbellate, with pedicels not all the same length and one or twow in each cluster emerging slightly below the others. The species intergrades with both B. erects and B. triquetra in different parts of its range. Ethnobotany : The species serves as host for a moth that was eaten in the larval stage by the O'odham tribes. Etymology : Boerhavia is named to honor Dutch botanist Hermann Boerhaave (1663-1738); intermedia means in between.

Notes : The genus Panicum is defined as having unawned spikelets with 2 florets, the first floret sterile or staminate, and the second floret bisexual with a rigid lemma that clasps the palea. This species is a hardy, hairy annual grass, growing in spreading tufts from 16-20 inches high, the tufts being then covered with large pyramidal panicles of graceful airy form, purplish in color. It grows in any soil, often sows itself, and is suited for borders or beds being one of the most graceful of grasses. Several related species were formerly classified as subspecies of P. capillare; true P. capillare is set apart from those by its long pedicels, 8-20 mm long, which gently curve and are not stiff and straight; the panicle diffusely branched and usually at least half the height of the plant; the first glume half the length of the spikelet; and spikelets about 3 mm long. Ethnobotany : Seed is cooked whole or ground into a powder and used as a flour. It is often mixed with corn. The seed is very small and fiddly to use. It has a mild flavor and can be used like millet. Etymology : Panicum is a classical Latin name for millet, while capillare means hair-like, referring to the panicle branches.

Sandy to gravelly flats and slopes, saltbush, creosote bush, greasewood, blackbrush, and mesquite communities, rarely in pinyon-juniper woodlands; 500-1400 m; Ariz., Calif., Nev., Utah. Eriogonum insigne has been a troublesome taxon. The type, collected by E. Palmer in 1876, is a curious specimen from near Paragonah in Iron County, Utah. That expression has not been re-collected and, after another frustrating review of the type material, it is now referred to E. deflexum , along with other odd specimens from southern Nevada and California that have always been difficult to assign. As a result, the tall, upright plants with long, whiplike branches of northwestern Arizona (Mohave County), southern Nevada (northeastern Clark and southern Lincoln counties), and southwestern Utah (southwestern Washington County), are now recognized under the name E. exaltatum . Some specimens remain problematic. Immature plants of E. exaltatum ( Goodding 2302 , GH, MIN, MO, NY, RM, UC) resemble E. bifurcatum. pecimens from Eureka Valley ( DeDecker 4741 , NY) and western Pahrump Valley ( Abrams 14248 , DS, GH, NY) in Inyo County, California, appear to belong to E. exaltatum . Like Eriogonum exaltatum , some populations of E. deflexum var. deflexum have nearly erect involucres. The plants from the Buried Hills (Nye and Clark counties, Nevada) are particularly odd. Single plants from a few collections in Kane County, Utah, have sessile, seemingly erect involucres in the forks of inflorescence branches. None of these plants has the characteristic long, whiplike branches of E. exaltatum , and they are not included in E. deflexum var. deflexum . The type of E. deflexum var. rectum from San Bernardino County, California ( Reveal & Broome 6385 , CAS, NY, US, etc.), has individual specimens with both deflexed and somewhat erect involucres, along with whiplike branches. Collections from Imperial and San Diego counties, previously associated with what is here termed E. exaltatum , are now considered specimens of E. deflexum .

Inflorescences terminal, occupying distal 1/ 2 of stem, narrowly paniculate, rarely simple. Pedicels articulated near middle or in proximal 1/ 3, filiform, 5-15(-20) mm, articulation indistinct. Flowers 5-20 in whorls; inner tepals oblong-cordate or orbiculate-cordate, 11-16 × 9.5-14 mm, base sinuate or emarginate, margins entire, rarely with few extremely small denticles at base, apex obtuse or subacute; tubercles absent. Achenes brown or reddish brown, 4-5(-7) × 2.5-4.5(-5) mm. 2 n = 40. Flowering spring. Sandy and rocky places: plains, slopes, stream beds, alkaline soils; 0-1700(-2000) m; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Mont., Nev., N.Mex., Okla., Tex., Utah, Wyo.; Mexico (Baja California, Chihuahua). Rumex hymenosepalus is the only species of subsect. Hymenosepali Rechinger f. Two varieties have been recognized. The typical variety has achenes 5 mm and ovate-elliptic or oblong-cordate inner tepals with a subacute apex. Variety salinus (A. Nelson) Rechinger f. has larger achenes (to 7 mm) and almost orbiculate inner tepals with an obtuse apex. Rumex hymenosepalus was reported also from Montana (J. E. Dawson 1979), but no exact localities were given.",,"FNA 2005, Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Coarse perennial 30-100 cm tall, with 1-several tuberous roots, glabrous or indistinctly papillose-pubescent.

Stems: branches flexible to ± brittle at base, yellow-brown to gray-brown, pubescent to glabrescent; branchlets usually yellowish or yellow-green, sometimes reddish brown, puberulent or pubescent to glabrescent. Leaves: stipules broad rudiments or foliaceous on early ones, foliaceous on late ones, (glands numerous adaxially), apex rounded to convex; petiole (sometimes with spherical glands distally), 4-10 mm, pilose adaxially; largest medial blade (sometimes amphistomatous), narrowly elliptic, very broadly oblong, lorate, or linear, 67-130 × 9.5-16 mm, 4.7-12.4 times as long as wide, base cuneate to convex, margins serrulate to serrate, apex acuminate, caudate, or acute, abaxial surface (usually not glaucous, rarely thinly so), glabrous or puberulent, hairs wavy, adaxial slightly glossy, pilose to glabrescent; proximal blade margins entire or shallowly serrulate; juvenile blade sparsely velvety to pilose abaxially, hairs white. Catkins: staminate 19-80 × 6-10 mm, flowering branchlet 2-23 mm; pistillate 23-82 × 6-15 mm, flowering branchlet 2-48 mm; floral bract 1.4-2.4 mm, apex acute or rounded, entire or toothed, abaxially sparsely to moderately densely hairy, hairs wavy; pistillate bract deciduous after flowering. Staminate flowers: abaxial nectary (0.2-)0.3-0.6 mm, adaxial nectary square to ovate, 0.2-0.6 mm, nectaries distinct; stamens 4-6(-8); filaments (sometimes basally connate), hairy on proximal 1/2; anthers 0.4-0.5 mm, (axes straight). Pistillate flowers: adaxial nectary square (flattened), 0.2-0.6 mm; stipe 1.2-3.2 mm; ovary pyriform, (sometimes villous), beak slightly bulged or abruptly tapering to styles; ovules 12-18 per ovary; styles 0.1-0.3 mm; stigmas 0.2-0.29-0.32 mm. Capsules 6-7 mm. 2 n = 38. Flowering late Mar-Jun. Riparian forests, springs, seepage areas, washes, meadows; -40-500(-2500) m; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Nev., N.Mex., Okla., Tex., Utah; Mexico (Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Guerrero, Sinaloa, Sonora). Salix gooddingii and S. nigra are closely related and are sometimes treated as conspecific (C. R. Ball 1950). Salix gooddingii has yellow-brown or pale gray-brown branches, capsules 6-7 mm, and ovaries usually glabrous but pilose in ca. 20% of specimens. Salix nigra has red-brown to dark gray-brown branches, capsules 3-5 mm, and ovaries almost always glabrous. A single plant with pilose ovaries was found in Ontario, Canada; reports (W. A. Archer 1965) of S. nigra with hairy ovaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and Texas could not be confirmed. Ranges of these taxa overlap in west-central Texas, where there is evidence of intergradation; they rarely occur in the same population. The map by E. L. Little Jr. (1971), who treated them as conspecific, shows a significant range disjunction between the two. Catkins of Salix gooddingii flowering in March and early April are sometimes borne in leaf axils. This suggests that the sylleptic condition, typical of S. bonplandiana , is sometimes ecotypic. Hybrids: Salix gooddingii forms natural hybrids with S. amygdaloides and S. nigra . Hybrids with S. lasiandra have been reported (C. K. Schneider 1921); no convincing specimens have been seen. Salix gooddingii × S. laevigata : In Arizona, a popula-tion of young plants displays intermediate characteristics. They have leaf blades sparsely glaucous abaxially, as in S. laevigata , but narrow, often amphistomatous, and with petioles sometimes not glandular distally, as in S. gooddingii . Both parental species occur in the region. This hybrid was also reported by C. K. Schneider (1921) from California. Salix gooddingii × S. nigra : This hybrid may occur in western Texas where the parental species overlap. Some specimens from that area seem to be 'intermediate' in branch color, but the differences are subtle.","JANAS 29(1) Plant : Dioecious tree; to 30 m tall; branches flexible to brittle at base, yellow- to gray-brown, glabrous or becoming so; branchlets yellowish to yellow-green, sometimes reddish-brown, glabrous, pilose, or velvety becoming glabrous; budscale margins free and overlapping Leaves : stipules leaflike or rudimentary; petioles pilose, 4-10 mm long, gland-dotted at base of blade; proximal leaves on vegetative branchlets or on flowering branchlets entire, gland-dotted, or serrulate; young leaves pilose to velvety; mature blade linear to ligulate or very narrowly elliptic, 67-130 mm long, 9.5-16 mm wide, 4.7-12.4 times as long as wide, the lower surface non-glaucous, the upper surface shiny, the base acute to cuneate; margins flat, serrulate or serrate, with 5-10 teeth or glands per cm, the apex acuminate INFLORESCENCE : cylindrical or subspherical catkins; coetaneous; floral bracts tawny, 1.4-2.4 mm long with wavy hairs, the apices acute or rounded; pistillate floral bracts deciduous after flowering Flowers : STAMINATE FLOWERS in densely to loosely flowered catkins, 35-70 mm long; flowering branchlets 5-25 mm long; stamens 4-8; filaments hairy; nectaries 1-3 slender abaxial lobes. 1-2 square or ovate adaxial lobes, 0.25-0.5 mm long.

Pay attention to the margins of the corolla lobes-- they are densely ciliate-lanate with branched hairs and appear fuzzy even without the aid of a hand lens. Use that fuzzy corolla margin, combined with the flatter, less succulent leaves to distinguish this species from the otherwise similar L. andersonii. Ethnobotany : Used as a ceremonial emetic; for toothaches and chickenpox; the berries were eaten raw or cooked. Etymology : Lycium is from Greek name Lykion used to describe a thorny tree or shrub; torreyi is named for the great American botanist/chemist John Torrey (1796-1873).

Notes : Chenopodium is a genus of usually weedy annual herbs with simple, alternate leaves, herbage that is commonly farinose (with mealy, or floury hairs) to some degree, and clusters of small green flowers lacking petals, which mature into fruits composed of a single seed wrapped in the persistent calyx. The leaves of C. berlandieri are farinose on the underside but can be glabrous above, and usually have irregular, shallow teeth or lobes. It is similar to several other Chenopodiums, with differences being that this species has relatively large, dense glomerules of flowers; the calyx adheres tightly to the fruit at maturity; seed coats are pitted; and the leaves have shallow teeth in the margins. C. fremontii has mostly entire leaves with only a pair of lobes at the base, and smooth seeds; C. album has leaves that are similar to C. berlandieri but the seeds are smooth or only lightly ridged. In general, mature seeds are necessary for conclusive ID of any species within the Chenopodium genus. Look for it in Chenopodiaceae in older texts; that entire family is now considered to be part of Amaranthaceae. Ethnobotany : Leaves are edible.

Ecology : Found on mesas, arid plains, and slopes, usually under shrubs; below 6,000 ft (1829 m); flowers March-June. Distribution : AZ, s NM, sw TX; south to c MEX. Notes : The genus Acourtia in our region is distinguished by being erect perennial composites with woolly bases of brownish-bronze hairs; leathery, sessile or clasping leaves with toothed margins, the teeth often with prickles; and often showy heads with pink, purple or white flowers. A. nana is distinct from other Acourtia in the region by its small stature and grayish-green, leathery, holly-like, roundish prickly leaves which clasp the stems. The flowers are fragrant, the scent reminiscent of violets. Ethnobotany : Cottonlike material at root base placed on a newborn-s umbilicus. Etymology : Acourtia is named for Mary Elizabeth Catherine Gibbes A-Court (1792-1878), while nana is from Greek nannos, dwarf.

Amer. including every state in the US; south to C. Amer. Notes : A common but variable species of many North American regions and climates. Distinguished by its perennial, herbaceous growth form; aromatic, gray-green foliage often covered in a mat of tangled hairs; the leaves sometimes simple but most often divided into lobes 0.5-1 cm wide (thinner lobes in other local Artemisia spp.), each lobe often with a point at the end. Easily confused with A. carruthii but leaves are larger with wider, more robust lobes (vs. smaller leaves with thin linear lobes in A. carruthii). These two species may hybridize. Five subspecies are found in AZ: subsp. albula; subsp. ludoviciana; subsp. mexicana; subsp. redolens (rare); and subsp. sulcata. Characters distinguishing among the subspecies are related to leaf shape, color, and pubescence. The species- hardiness, wide range of native habitats, and -mat-like- growth form make it potentially valuable in soil and vegetation restoration efforts. It is a host plant for Painted Lady butterfly. Ethnobotany : Branches used in sweathouses. Used throughout the Intermountain west as a medicinal bitter, a purifying and cleansing plant, and for making towels.

Notes : This species is native to North America and has a long history of cultivation, originally by native Americans  for its edible seed. It is said to be the only North American plant to become a major agronomic crop, now cultivated worldwide for edible seeds and oil production. A related native species, H. petiolaris, is very similar but smaller and more slender in all respects, with phyllaries lanceolate and usually not ciliate-margined, and the central receptacle scales conspicuously white-bearded at the tip. Helianthus specimens can be difficult to assign to species, especially since hybridization sometimes occurrs, including backcrossing between wild and cultivated individuals.

Harms (1965) acknowledged the difficulty in finding consistent characters to separate plants on a geographic basis, as did Nesom (1990e). Harms (1970) noted that H. psammophila and H. latifolia are probably conspecific. It seems best to treat the complex as a single polymorphic species. In historic times, human-assisted dispersal of possibly once distinct races has likely resulted in blurring of such distinctions with one exception. Plants of the outer coastal plain from Texas to North Carolina usually have a cluster of coarse hairs near the tip of phyllaries, at least in summer and fall-blooming plants.",,"FNA 2006, Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Erect annual to biennial herb 40-150 cm tall with striate and short-hirsute stems, moderately branched above.

Matricaria discoidea has been used as a medicinal and aromatic plant by Native American tribes (D. E. Moerman 1998). It also is considered a weed, and it is resistant to a photosystem II inhibitor herbicide in the United Kingdom (www.weedscience.org). It is a northwestern North American native that has spread to eastern and northern North America and elsewhere (E. McClintock 1993b; E. G. Voss 1972-1996, vol. 3; A. Cronquist 1994). NatureServe (www.natureserve.org) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (plants.usda.gov) erroneously present M. discoidea as introduced on the continent. Its natural habitat is ill-defined because the species has become ruderal even in its native range. For discussion of the nomenclature of this taxon, see S. Rauschert (1974); K. N. Gandhi and R. D. Thomas (1991); Cronquist; and Voss. Matricaria matricarioides (Lessing) Porter cannot be applied to the American taxon; M. matricarioides was originally published as Artemisia matricarioides Lessing, a new name for Tanacetum pauciflorum Richardson (see S. Rauschert 1974), itself a synonym of T. huronense Nuttall. W. Greuter (pers. comm.), who accepts M. discodea , considers Rauschert´s treating Artemisia matricarioides as homotypic with T. pauciflorum as equivalent to a lectotype designation.",,,Matricaria discoidea,ASTERACEAE,annual,non-native,0,herb,0.0,2700.0

Floodplains, streambanks, dry lake beds, dunes, sand flats; 40-1000 m; Ariz., Calif., Nev., N.Mex., Tex., Utah; Mexico (Baja California, Chihuahua, Sonora). Pluchea sericea (with its woody habit and eglandular, densely arranged, sericeous leaves) is isolated among North American Pluchea . Torrey and Gray recognized its close similarity to the Asian Pluchea lanceolata (de Candolle) Oliver & Hiern, the type species of the Asian genus Berthelotia . It has been treated within Berthelotia and the South American and Central American segregate Tessaria , and a distinct genus ( Eremohylema A. Nelson) has been created for it. Pluchea sericea is more similar to the segregates than to herbaceous American groups; the delimitations of the genera are not clear. Tessaria was restricted to T. integrifolia Ruiz & Pavón, based on its single functionally staminate flower per head and corolla lobes cut nearly to the base of the limb, by H. Robinson and J. Cuatrecasas (1973). The sister species of T. integrifolia appears to be T. absinthoides (Hooker & Arnott) Cabrera [= Pluchea absinthoides (Hooker & Arnott) H. Robinson & Cuatrecasas]. Both species have inner phyllaries with reflexing tips, alveolate and paleate receptacles, pappus bristles basally united into a thick cup, and other distinctive floral features (G. L. Nesom 1989). It seems likely that the accepted definition of Tessaria may be expanded to two species or more broadly to include P. sericea and the species placed in Berthelotia . Alternately, Berthelotia (including P. sericea ) might be accepted at generic rank, coordinate with Tessaria . In any case, it seems likely that P. sericea ultimately will be treated outside a more strictly circumscribed Pluchea .",,"FNA 2006, Wiggins 1964 Common Name : arrowweed Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Shrub Wetland Status : FACW General : Slender, willow-like shrub, 1.5-3 m tall, erect and considerably branched, with densely pubescent stems.

Distribution : Native to the New World and widespread throughout the US and CAN; south through MEX, C. Amer., to the tip of S. America; widely introduced in the Old World. Notes : Easily distinguished by its large fruits that are burs with long hooked bristles. The leaves sand-papery to the touch, and the flowers resemble those of ragweed (Ambrosia spp.) Many subspecies and varieties have been proposed based on burr morphology, but FNA does not formally recognize any of them. Burrs become entangled in animal hides and hikers' socks, promoting the dispersal of the seeds. Seeds and cotyledon leaves are poisonous to livestock, while morning doves eat the seeds. Ethnobotany : The leaves made into a tea make a useful diuretic, but in large quantities it can have toxic effects. The plant can be used to make a yellow dye.

Distribution : s CA, AZ, s CO, NM, s TX; n MEX. Notes : Astragalus is the most species-rich genus in the world and is especially speciose in the southwest. There are over 200 taxa in Arizona alone. Many species are notoriously difficult so its best to voucher to be sure. This species is a perennial but appearing annual, ranging from small and ground-hugging, to large and straggly; distinguished by having stems which branch above the ground (caulescent); stiff, appressed hairs all over (strigose);  leaflet number and width and with more hairs underneath; flowers 6-8 mm long; 1 celled, thin-walled, inflated pods which greatly surpass the calyx which has teeth as long as, or slightly shorter than the tube. Ethnobotany : Used ceremonially by the Navajo. Etymology : Astragalus is from Greek astragalos meaning ankle bone and is an early name applied to the genus because of the shape of the seeds, allochrous means of a different color.

Formerly, California populations of what here is referred to as Quercus john-tuckeri have been included in the concept of Q . turbinella . Quercus john-tuckeri has subsessile fruit and noncordate leaf bases as opposed to the consistently pedunculate fruit and strongly cordate leaf bases of Q . turbinella . The two species seem to be no more closely related to each other than each might be to other southwestern oaks, and Q . john-tuckeri shares at least as many characteristics with Q . berberidifolia as with Q . turbinella . Thus, treatment of these two taxa as varieties of the same species is inappropriate.

Subspecies intermontana is distinguished from subsp. mexicana by beet red or green herbage and gas pockets on the basal leaves (vs. green herbage only and no gas pockets). These subspecies have different geographical ranges (Chambers 1993, Miller 1978); subsp. intermontana grows in northwestern Arizona (Yavapai and Mohave Cos.), and subsp. mexicana grows in central to southern Arizona. It has been suggested that the subspecies of C. perfoliata may be difficult to identify due to environmental plasticity, genetic mixing among polyploids, and geographic overlap of distinct self-pollinating forms (Miller 1978).","FNA 2003, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Spreading to erect annual with minute, tuberous bodies, stems 5-50 cm. Leaves : Basal leaves in suberect to erect, seldom flattened rosettes, petiolate, 1-30 cm long, blade often with weak red pigmentation, broadly rhombic to deltate or reniform 1-7 cm long, apex obtuse to apiculate with a mucro 1-3 mm long, blade perfoliate or cleft and notched, 10 cm diameter or less. Flowers : Inflorescence stalked or sessile, open or densely with 5-40 flowers, 1-bracteate, bract leaflike, 0.5-15 mm; flowers 3-10 mm; sepals 1.5-4 mm; petals pink or white, 2-5 mm, 3 ovules. Fruits : Capsule 1.5-4 mm long, 3 valved. Ecology : Found in moist, often shady or disturbed sites from 2,500-7,500 ft ( 762-2286 m); flowers February-May. Notes : Three subspecies in Arizona: subsp. intermontana, subsp. mexicana, and subsp. perfoliata. They are told apart by subsp. perfoliata having erect basal leaf rosettes, 20-50 cm, with cauline leaf pairs connate into perfoliate discs and blade margins are entire. Ssp. intermontana has broadly ovate to rhombic basal leaves, with leaves that are beet red, gray-green or purplish. Ssp. mexicana has deltate leaves with an apiculate apex, with mostly green leaf blades. Generally told apart from C. parvifolia by the more linear-ovate leaves. Ethnobotany : Used for rheumatic pains, for sore eyes, and eaten raw as greens. Etymology : Claytonia is named for John Clayton (1694-1774) an American botanist, while perfoliata refers to the stem that perforates the leaf, the perfoliate leaf.

Leaves  basal and cauline; blade with ultimate lobes obtuse or acute.  Inflorescences  cymose or 1-flowered; buds erect.  Flowers:  receptacle obconic, cup with spreading free rim; calyx acute to acuminate, glabrous, sometimes glaucous; petals yellow to orange, usually with orange spot at base, 20-60 mm.  Capsules  3-9 cm.  Seeds  brown to black, spheric to ellipsoid, 1.5-1.8 mm, reticulate. Eschscholzia californica is the state flower of California. Although it is toxic to humans, its roots are relished by gophers. Widely planted in North America and elsewhere as an ornamental, roadside, and reclamation plant, with many color forms in the horticultural trade, it often escapes but usually does not persist. This species is highly variable (more than 90 infraspecific taxa have been described), not only among different plants and locations but also within individual plants over the course of the growing season, especially in petal size and color (see W. L. Jepson 1909-1943, vol. 1, part 7, pp. 564-569). Native Americans used Eschscholzia californica (no varieties specified) to treat lice, to induce sleep in children, as a poison, for consumption, for toothaches, and as an emetic (D. E. Moerman 1986).","JANAS 30(2) Plant : Annual or perennial herb; 0.5-6 dm tall Leaves : basal and sometimes also cauline, erect or spreading, glabrous, sometimes glaucous; terminal leaf divisions obtuse or acute, often widened at the tips, 0.5-11 mm long INFLORESCENCE : scapes or few- to many-flowered cymes Flowers : bud erect, lance-ovoid, acute to long-pointed; outer rim spreading to recurved, 0.5-6 mm wide; inner rim erect, hyaline, less than 1 mm tall; sepals glabrous, sometimes glaucous, 8-40 mm long; petals orange to yellow, sometimes with a darker orange basal spot, (0.9-) 1.5-7.0 cm long Fruit : capsules. cylindric, dehiscent from base, 3-11 cm long.

inland species and grows on open slopes, grass balds, shrublands, meadows,
and open forests, in montane and subalpine zones. It grows from British
Columbia to Saskatchewan, south throughout the western United States, and also
extends into northern Mexico. Its elevational range is 350-2200 m in the
northern part of its distribution, and 1500-3300 m in the south. Bromus carinatus var. marginatus is variable, and
intergrades with B. carinatus var. carinatus -to the west, B. aleutensis -to the north, and B. polyanthus -to the southeast. As treated here, B. carinatus var. marginatus includes B.
luzonensis J. Presl,
which has been recognized mainly on the basis of its canescent sheaths and
blades; this trait seems highly variable and may be environmentally determined.
Although the name Bromus carinatus var. marginatus was attributed to
Hitchcock by Scoggan, there is no evidence that either A.S. or C.L. Hitchcock
actually made the combination. Bromus polyanthus grows on open slopes and in meadows. It is found primarily in the central Rocky
Mountains, but the limits of its range include British Columbia in the north,
California in the west, and Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas in the south.
It is sometimes treated as var. polyanthus -with an erect, contracted panicle and awns 4-6
mm long; and as var. paniculatus -with an open, nodding panicle and awns up to 8
mm long. Because the variation in both characters is continuous, the varieties
are not recognized here.",,"FNA 2007, Field Guide to Forest & Mtn. Plants of N AZ 2009, Utah Flora 1983; Ann.

Phalaris angusta grows in the contiguous United States, and in Ecuador south to Chile and Argentina. Its North American distribution is disjunct, including California and Oregon in the west and the coastal region between Texas and Georgia in the southeast. In South America, it is most abundant in a band from Chile to Argentina; it also grows in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Thellung (1912) considered it to be a South America species that is adventive in North America. Throughout its distribution, it tends to grow in open grasslands and prairies. Baldini (1995) suggested that P. angusta , P. lemmonii , and P. caroliniana are
involved in reciprocal hybridization and introgression, particularly in

Polygonum aviculare is a taxonomically controversial polyploid complex of selfing annuals. Although members of the complex have been considered inbreeders, they possess some structures that make cross pollination possible. Cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers, heterostyly, protandry, and the capacity to secrete nectar suggest an ancestral mixed-mating system. Isoenzyme studies showed that the complex has an allopolyploid origin (P. Meerts et al. 1998) and has evolved as a swarm of inbreeding lines ('Jordanons') (J. Gasquez et al. 1978). The six subspecies included here have been treated variously (T. Karlsson 2000; M. Costea and F. J. Tardif 2003). Complex intergradation patterns among them make their recognition at the species level impractical. Multivariate analysis and isoenzyme studies show that populations with intermediate characteristics may occur (Meerts et al. 1990, 1998).

Rumex crispus (belonging to subsect. Crispi Rechinger f.; see K. H. Rechinger 1937) is the most widespread and ecologically successful species of the genus, occuring almost worldwide as a completely naturalized and sometimes invasive alien. It has not been reported from Greenland, but it probably occurs there. Rumex crispus hybridizes with many other species of subg. Rumex . Hybrids with R. obtusifolius ( Rumex × pratensis Mertens & Koch) are the most common in the genus, at least in Europe, and have been reported for several localities in North America. Rumex crispus × R. patientia ( Rumex × confusus Simonkai) was reported from New York. According to R. S. Mitchell (1986, p. 47), 'this hybrid is now spreading along highway shoulders, and it has replaced R. crispus in some local areas.' However, that information should be confirmed by more detailed studies since spontaneous hybrids between species of sect. Rumex usually are much less fertile and ecologically successful than the parental species. Hybrids of Rumex occuring in North America need careful revision. Numerous infraspecific taxa and even segregate species have been described in the Rumex crispus aggregate. Many seem to represent minor variation of little or no taxonomic significance, but some are geographically delimited entities that may deserve recognition as subspecies or varieties. The typical variety has inner tepals with three well-developed tubercles; the less common var. unicallosus Petermann, with one tubercle, occurs sporadically in North America. Some eastern Asian plants differ from typical Rumex crispus is having somewhat smaller inner tepals, longer pedicels, lax inflorescences with remote whorls, and narrower leaves that are almost flat or indistinctly undulate at the margins. These plants, originally described as R. fauriei Rechinger f., are now treated as R. crispus subsp. fauriei (Rechinger f.) Mosyakin & W. L. Wagner; the subspecies was recently reported from Hawaii (S. L. Mosyakin and W. L. Wagner 1998) and may be expected as introduced in western North America.",,"Wiggins 1964, Martin and Hutchins 1980, Heil et al 2013, FNA 2005, USDA GRIN Duration : Perennial Nativity : Non-Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Perennial herb, 30-120 cm tall, from a spindle-shaped, vertical rootstock; stems stout, erect, simple or branched above the middle, glabrous, and greenish to reddish. Leaves : In a basal rosette and alternate along the stems, on slender petioles. Basal leaves lanceolate, 10-40 cm long, with ruffled (crisped) edges; stem leaves smaller. Ocrea (stipules fused into a sheath which surrounds the stem at the base of each leaf) 1-7 cm long, tan, membranaceous, early-deciduous. Flowers : Greenish, in a terminal panicle which occupies the top half of the plant; panicle branches ascending, 10-50 cm long and densely flowered with whorls of 10- 25 bisexual flowers; each flower has 3 outer bract-like tepals and 3 winged inner tepals called valves which enlarge to 4-6 mm long in fruit, the wings forming a broadly ovate to orbicular shape with mostly entire margins; each valve usually has a grain-like tubercle called a callosity. Fruits : Achenes trigonous, 2-3 mm high, reddish-brown, surrounded by the three enlarged inner tepals (valves). Ecology : Found in moist areas from 3,000-9,000 ft (914-2743 m); ubiquitous in temperate North America; flowers March-October. Distribution : Native to Eurasia and northern Africa; naturalized throughout the world; throughout N. Amer. and in every state in the US. Notes : An incredibly common tall biennial or perennial of moist soils; distinguished by the leaves which are crinkled or crisped along the edges, hence the species' name; the inner tepals or valves, seen as 3 wings on the fruits, are 4-6 mm long, have edges that are mostly without teeth, and have drops of hard tissue in the middle termed collosities. The inflorescence, which encompasses the top half of the plant, is distinctly red when in fruit. Host plant for Purplish Copper butterfly. Ethnobotany : Plant is used by many tribes medicinally. Common uses are root or seed poultices for swelling and skin irritations. Considered a liver stimulant and blood purifier. Some tribes make tea to purify blood or treat urinary problems. Tea salve is made for skin problems. Slow root tea is used to treat diarrhea, stimulate appetite, and for intestinal cold. Tea is also made into a wash for face, hands and clothing as love medicine. Seeds, greens and stems are consumed by many tribes. Pima, Cheyenne, and Choctaw also make yellow dye from roots. Etymology : Rumex is the classical Latin name for dock, possibly derived from rumo, to suck, in reference to the practice of sucking the leaves to allay thirst; crispus is from the Latin crisp, meaning curled, in reference to the leaves.

No specimens have been seen from Delaware, but the species is to be expected there. The sago-pondweed is among the most important species as food for waterfowl (E. Moore 1913). The species reproduces vegetatively by underground tubers and is spread by various duck species, especially canvas backs. In a study of food for ducks, a population of canvas backs was observed feeding in aquatic vegetation comprised of several genera, including sago-pondweed. When the stomach contents were examined, they were found to contain essentially 100% tubers of sago-pondweed (E. Moore 1913). Two hybrids with this species as a putative parent have been described under the genus Potamogeton.

Sporangia  containing 32 or 64 spores. Astrolepis sinuata comprises two cytotypes that tend to occupy different ranges and are treated here as subspecies. Sexual diploid populations (subsp. mexicana ) are widely distributed in Mexico, but in the flora they are apparently confined to the Davis and Chisos mountains of Texas and to southeast New Mexico. The range of the apogamous triploid (subsp. sinuata ) extends from Argentina to the southwestern United States, with a disjunct population in Georgia. Isozyme studies suggest that subsp. sinuata was derived from the diploid subsp. mexicana through autopolyploidy (D. M.

Cheilanthes covillei can be difficult to distinguish from the closely related C . intertexta and C . clevelandii ; it differs from these two species in having glabrous blades and costal scales ciliate only on the basal lobes. Cheilanthes covillei is occasionally misidentified as C . fendleri because the cilia of the scales are often obscure; it is distinguished from the latter species by having rigid, dark brown stem scales that are strongly appressed. Cheilanthes covillei hybridizes with C . parryi and C . newberryi to form rare, sterile diploids known as C . × parishii Davenport and C . × fibrillosa (Davenport) Davenport ex Underwood, respectively.

Leaves : Alternate, clustered near tips of branchlets, on flattened petioles that are nearly as long as the leaf blades; blades deltoid, 4-7 mm long and about as wide or wider, slightly cordate or cuneate at base and sharply pointed at the tip, with margins coarsely and irregularly toothed, and surfaces bright green and glabrous. Flowers : Catkins 4-13 cm long, with male and female catkins on the same tree; each flower subtended by a deeply cup-shaped disc, 3-9 mm wide. Fruits : Capsules globose or ellipsoid, 6-10 mm long; splitting open into 4 segments (valves) to release many tiny seeds attached to abundant white cottony hairs. Ecology : Found along streams banks and near lakes and ponds, below 6,500 ft (1981 m); flowers March-June. Distribution : CA, NV, UT, CO, AZ, NM, CO, TX; south to c MEX. Notes : A common, often large tree of southwestern streamsides, identified by its coarsely-toothed, shiny triangular leaves, large size, and spreading crown. This is the only broad-leaf cottonwood found in the low deserts of Arizona, but farther north and east the taxonomy is not so simple. Some authorities treat Fremont cottonwood as a variety of P. deltoides (see Allred and Ivey 2012, which recognizes 4 intergrading, hybridizing varieties of P. deltoides in New Mexico). Distinguish P. fremontii from other similar broad-leaf cottonwoods based on its leaf margins which are finely crenate-serrate with 20-30 teeth on each side of the blade (coarsely serrate with fewer than 20 teeth in other varieties); it lacks a pair of glands at the junction of leaf blade and petiole (P. deltiodes var. wislizeni also lacks these glands but vars. deltoides and occidentalis have the glands); and its short fruiting pedicels, 2-5 mm long, and large floral discs, 4-9 mm wide in fruit (P. deltoides var. wislizenii has fruiting pedicels 7-15 mm long and narrower floral discs, 1-4 mm wide in fruit). Ethnobotany : Hopi use this tree to make Katchina dolls. Used by the Navajo to make many game pieces. Etymology : Populus is the classical Latin name for poplar trees; fremontii honors US Army officer and western explorer John C. Fremont (1813-1890) who collected this species in California.

Notes : Distinguished by its annual, herbaceous life form to a meter tall, often dark green, broad lance-elliptic leaves, white Solanaceous corollas with yellow anthers and dark blue mature berries. Similar to S. americanum but tends to have larger flowers (diameter of 2-6 mm and <3 mm long in americanum, >3mm long in douglasii)  and longer anthers (<1 mm long in americanum >2 mm long in douglasii). In the southwest, these two species are a part of the cosmopolitan -S. nigrum complex-,  a group of over 30 species with continuous variation, hybridization, polyploidy and many evolutionary intermediates, often making for difficult classification. Ethnobotany : Used for food and fodder, or as dyes and their use dates back to the earliest records of written history.

Fruits : Nutlets 4, enclosed in calyx. Ecology : Found in rocky to sandy soils, in open woods, wash bottoms, and stream margins, from 2,000-10,000 ft (610-3048 m); flowers May-September. Distribution : SD to MO and AL, west to CO and AZ; south to n MEX. Also in cultivation. Notes : This fairly common perennial is hard to miss with its showy, nectiferous purple flowers and hairy, pinnately lobed leaves. It is distinguished from other Glandularia, especially G. gooddingii, by the floral bracts being slightly longer than the calyx, and the herbage being hirsute, and not glandular. There are a number of varieties which have been recognized as distinct species at one time or another. Neesom (2010) completed a treatment for the complex, some of which was incorporated into Allred and Ivey (2012) but differences amonth the taxa are subtle. Ethnobotany : Leaves rubbed on snakebites; used to make a gargle for sore throat and as a life medicine. Etymology : Glandularia is from the Latin gland, probably referring to the glandular pubescence of many species, while bipinnatifida refers to the twice-pinnate leaves.

The name Amaranthus graecizans , which refers to a species of Old World origin, has been misapplied to both A. albus and A. blitoides in earlier North American floras and manuals. Southwestern plants differing from typical Amaranthus albus in having viscid pubescence and usually distinctly crisped leaf margins may be recognized as var. pubescens ; they were occasionally treated as a separate species, A. pubescens .

Plants bushy (large plants forming tumbleweeds); up to 1 m tall,  stems whitish in color. Leaves : Alternate, petiole half as long as blade, or longer in young proximal leaves; blade obovate to narrowly spatulate with a tapering or cuneate base, margins entire  to crispate-undulate, apex obtuse with whitish or yellowish subspinescent mucro. Leaves mostly small, 3 cm long by 1 cm wide, but early  leaves are larger, up to 8 cm. Flowers : Inflorescences are axillary glomerules with male and female flowers intermixed.

Ecology : Common agricultural weed. Found on disturbed sites, along roads, and in fields from 1,500-8,000 ft (457-2438 m); flowers June-October. Distribution : Widespread and weedy species that ranges all across the United States and into Mexico. Especially common in the West. USDA PLANTS lists this species as introduced to North America, but several other sources list the species as native. Heil et al (2013) states that the species is probably native to central and western North American and is adventive elsewhere. Notes : Confusingly, the USDA PLANTS database lists the common name for this species as ""prostrate pigweed""- even though the growth form is most often erect and bushy. This erect, tumbleweed-like growth form and generally more whitish stems help to separate this species from others in the genus. Also look for the often crispate (wavy) leaf margins. Ethnobotany : Uses are recorded for the Chiricahua Apache, Mescalero Apache, Navajo, and Hopi. Used to make flour and  bread, the greens were prepared with meat, the seeds were used for other types of food, and it had some ceremonial uses. Etymology : Amaranthus comes from the Greek amarantos, ""unfading,"" referring to the long-lasting flowers; albus means white.

Bassia hyssopifolia has been reported from southern Saskatchewan, but H. J. Scoggan (1978-1979, part 3) noted that this record possibly referred to Kochia scoparia (Linnaeus) Schrader. Putative hybrids between B. hyssopifolia and K. scoparia are reported from Utah (S. L. Welsh 1984). Such hybridization is extremely interesting because it has not been reported within the native ranges of those species in Eurasia. I have seen only one specimen that might represent such a hybrid.

Notes : This annual weed is distinguished from other similar species by the hooked spines on its outer perianth segments. It is known to hybridize with Kochia scoparia, which is has been treated in the genus Bassia due to this hybridization. In addition to the differences in the fruiting structure, Fivehook Bassia is also hairier than Kochia scoparia. Fivehook Bassia resembles Russian thistle in growth form, but is hairier and has wider, less succulent leaves.

Ecology : Found on dry, rocky slopes and mesas, in canyons, and oak pine juniper woodlands from 1,000-6,000 ft (305-1829 m); flowering February-December. Distribution : s AZ and extreme s CA, south throughout the Mexican Highlands and the Transvolcanic belt. Notes : The needle-like appearance of the leaves is a dead giveaway, but you can also identify this species by the puberulent, reddish stems, the hoods without recurved tips, not arching at the apex, and the widened, triangular anther wings. The plants are unlike any other milkweed species and small individuals are commonly confused with juvenile pine trees. Known to be used as a monarch host plant but only occasionally, likely due to its high toxicity and milkiness. Ethnobotany : There is no specific use recorded but other species in the genus have uses. Etymology : Asclepias is named for the Greek God of healing Asklepios, while linaria likely means linear, parallel-sided, referring to the leaf shape.

Considerable variation occurs, some of it geographically restricted to southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico.  Most such plants from the latter areas have been referred to N. texana or N. caudata, but are here included in N. microcarpa.  In the Grand Canyon area, there are variants that have been referred to N. parryi because in width the leaves approach those of  N. parryi and they are serrulate.  These plants, however, are acaulescent and also are here included in N. microcarpa.  B. J. Albee et al.

Artemisia dracunculus is widely cultivated as a culinary herb and may be introduced in parts of its range. It is easily cultivated from rootstocks, and while establishment from seeds is rare, seedlings can be found with amenable environmental conditions. Because of its popularity as an herb, it may suffer from overcollecting. Its scarcity in Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois (J. T. Kartesz and C. A. Meacham 1999) may have been caused by overly enthusiastic collecting as well as habitat loss.",,"FNA 2006, Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Subshrub General : Perennial herb or subshrub, 50-120 cm tall, from rhizomes and coarse caudices, strongly tarragon-scented to unscented; stems numerous, erect to ascending, green to reddish brown, markedly striate. Leaves : Alternate, sessile; blades gray-green and sparsely hairy or bright green and glabrous; lowermost leaves 3-cleft into lance-linear divisions 1-5 cm long; upper leaves linear to oblong, tapering to base, 1-7 cm long by 1-5 mm wide, mostly entire, sometimes irregularly lobed, acute.

Distribution : Eurasia and much of western N. America; south to C. America. Notes : This perennial herb has inflorescences of many small, drooping heads and thin leaves, typical of many Artemesia in the region. It is distinguished by having the smell and taste of tarragon (though many northern AZ populations lack this trait); many leafy stems from the base; and thin, mostly entire leaves which are most often hairless and green on both surfaces. These bright green leaves are atypical of regional Artemesia, which are usually gray-green. A. dracunculus is the wild plant from which the culinary herb tarragon was cultivated. Ethnobotany : Culinary uses as a tea, a spice, and the leaves and seeds were eaten. Also burned to keep away mosquitos. Extensive medicinal uses including treatment of dysentery, colic in infants, urinary problems, swollen feet and legs, headaches, arthritic pain, diaper rash, colds, chickenpox sores, venereal diseases, nettle stings. Also used stop women-s menstruation, as a heart medicine, and as a wash for open sores. Used to help promote hair growth and make hair long and soft, and as a love charm.

Carthamus tinctorius is apparently native originally to the eastern Mediterranean; it is known only in cultivation and as escapes today. Safflower has been reported from Texas; I have not seen the specimen. Safflower is cultivated as an oil seed, a source of vegetable dye, as birdseed, and as an ornamental. It is one of the earliest known crop plants, with cultivation dating back to prehistoric times. In the United States safflower is grown principally in California and Arizona; it has been a successful crop in every state west of the 100th meridian. Carthamus oxyacantha M. Bieberstein (wild safflower) was collected in 1978 in Monterey County, California. It is considered by the United States Department of Food and Agriculture to be a noxious weed subject to eradication if found. In central and southern Asia it is a pernicious weed of agricultural lands and other disturbed ground. Carthamus oxyacantha most closely resembles cultivated safflower; it has smaller heads and much spinier leaves.

Distribution : AZ, CA, NM, NV, and UT Notes : Look for this species under Aster tephrodes in older texts. There are many other synonyms as well, most notably Machaeranthera asteriodes. There have been a number of recent changes in what used to be the Aster genus, and species descriptions from different sources, even recent sources, are in conflict. This species description is roughly in line with the one in Flora of North America (2006), with edits based on which traits were actually visible and reliable on herbarium specimens at Northern Arizona University. There are 3 species in what is currently being called Dieteria: D. asteroides, D. canescens, and D. bigelovii. They are morphologically variable, challenging to distinguish from each other, and often intergrade so that differences described in the keys are not always helpful. D. asterides and D. canescens are the most similar; distinguish between them by looking at the phyllaries with your hand lens. The phyllaries on D. asteroides are hairy all over, on both the straw-colored bottom portion and the darker green tip, are more likely to have glandular hairs, and always have longer green tips, which are about as long as the light-colored portion and spreading so that they point outward or downward. D. canescens has less hairy phyllaries, which are often hairy on the green tip but usually not on the straw-colored base. The phyllaries on D. canescens are straw-colored for the lower two-thirds or more, with short green tips that do not spread away from the flower head or only spread a little. The third species, D. bigelovii, is easier to tell apart from the other two Dieteria spp. It has long narrow linear leaves with few, if any, shallow teeth or lobes, and larger flower heads, the largest flower heads on most plants having involucres about 2 cm or a little more in diameter (usually 1.5 cm or smaller involucres on D. asteroides and D. canescens.) D. bigelovii also has long-acuminate, reflexed (curved downward) phyllary tips, which are often tinged red or purple. Ethnobotany : Unknown.

Notes : This annual herb is a recent segregate from Gamochaeta purpurea (syn. Gnaphalium purpureum). It is distinguished from that species by its height and growth form, which tends to be shorter, less rigidly erect, and with more stems emerging at the base of the plant; the leaves which are about the same color on the upper and lower surfaces (G. purpurea is distinctly more grayish on the lower leaf surfaces); and the inner (and taller) rows of phyllaries which are bluntly rounded on the tip and tend to be more strongly infused with purple (use a hand lens; G. purpurea has pointy-tipped phyllaries which are less often purple-infused). G. purpurea is a somewhat more robust plant, considered to be a biennial to short lived perennial (this species is commonly annual but can persist into a second year).

Dry, open, sandy slopes, flats, dry drainages (relatively mesic sites in deserts), often on old disturbances; 0-1200(-1700) m; Ariz., Calif.; Mexico (Baja California, Sonora). Stylocline gnaphaloides (often misspelled ' gnaphalioides ') is relatively common in southwestern California, extending to the nearer Channel Islands, the San Francisco Bay area, and most of Baja California; it is not known from the Colorado River valley; it occurs in (mainly) disturbed areas of south-central Arizona and adjacent Sonora, Mexico. A specimen from Zion National Park, Utah, in 1937 is likely either mislabeled or from an introduction that did not persist. Forms with larger, often hairier heads ( Stylocline gnaphaloides var. bigelovii A. Gray, S . arizonica Coville) are more frequent inland but also occur (with intermediates) on the California Channel Islands and elsewhere; no taxonomic segregation seems warranted. Sterile hybrids with Logfia filaginoides do not much resemble S . citroleum , which is suspected to have originated from such parentage (J. D. Morefield 1992, 1992b).

Xanthisma gracile is a species of the Southwest that has been introduced in Maine and possibly other eastern states. Xanthisma gracile is treated here in the broad sense, to include the n = 4 Haplopappus ravenii in addition to the n = 2 and 3 chromosomal races. According to R. C. Jackson (1962, 1971), the n = 4 race can be distinguished from the other two races on the basis of floret and phyllary morphology. The former is said to possess fewer and shorter pappus bristles, shorter cypselae, and phyllaries that are covered by stiffer, more erect hairs. I have been unable to make this distinction with confidence. It is true that H. ravenii (based on specimens from its described geographic range, but not confirmed by chromosome counts) has phyllaries with often sparse, ascending to spreading hairs versus more numerous, longer, and generally appressed. Unfortunately, in surveying several hundred sheets of X. gracile in the broad sense, approximately twenty percent showed intermediacy in this character. Formal recognition of the n = 4 race has been questioned by A. Cronquist (1971) and others.",,"Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969, Jepson 1993, FNA 2006, Heil et al. 2013, Allred and Ivey 2012 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual herbs, 10-30 cm tall, from a taproot; stems freely branching, bristly.

Distribution : Southwestern US from CA and NV to CO and TX; south to MEX; also in Maine Notes : Currently classified in Xanthisma, this species has formerly been placed in several other genera including Machaeranthera, Aster, and Happlopappus. Look for a low annual with linear leaves lined with small bristle-tipped teeth, and yellow flower heads at the tips of most branches. Identify it as a member of the Machaeranthera/ Aster group by its flower heads with multiple rows of phyllaries, the outer much shorter than the inner, all with straw colored bases and dark green spots at the tip. However, it is easily distinguished from most members of the Machaeranthera/ Aster group by its yellow ray flowers (blue, purple and white are most common with other members of the group). Appears most similar to Xanthisma spinulosum (formerly Machaeranthera pinnatifida) which also has yellow ray flowers, but that species is a perennial growing from a more or less woody caudex.

The circumscription of Boechera perennans followed here is much narrower than that adopted by R. C. Rollins (1993). The most significant difference is the removal of Arabis gracilenta . Recent studies (M. D. Windham and Allphin, in prep.) indicate that the latter represents an older name for the species usually called A. ( Boechera ) selbyi . Although superficially similar, B. perennans is distinguished from B. gracilenta by having stems arising from above ground surface on woody bases, proximal stems with mostly Y-shaped trichomes, strongly dentate margins on basal leaves, and uniseriate seeds. Typically, B. perennans is a sexual diploid largely restricted to the warm deserts of Arizona, California, Nevada, and southern New Mexico.

Flowers : White to purple, in terminal racemes of 16-35 flowers, on 1-2 cm pedicels which are ascending in flower and horizontal in fruit; sepals 4, pubescent; petals 4 in a cross formation, white to purplish, 5-9 mm long and 1 mm wide. Fruits : Capsules linear, 3-7 cm long and 2 mm wide, usually curved, widely pendent, glabrous; seeds 1 mm long, 1 mm wide, winged,  in one row per locule. Ecology : Found on rocky slopes and gravelly soil in warm desert, chaparral, and low montane habitats, below 6,000 ft (1829 m); flowers February-May. Distribution : AZ, CA, NV, NM, TX, UT; south to n MEX Notes : Because of hybridization, polyploidy, and self-fertilization, Boechera is an extremely problematic group. There have been several re-organizations of this group over the years (including splitting it out from the genus Arabis). For simplicity it is better to use a recent treatment to identify your plants; this description is based on the Flora of North America treatment (2010) and the key divisions in the Flora Neomexicana (Allred and Ivey 2012). B. perennans is a fairly common early-flowering perennial in the warm desert regions of the southwest. One of its distinguishing features is that it often develops a footlike extension of the caudex between the basal leaves and the ground, appearing to be the consequence of shedding the basal leaves from the previous season. It is most similar to B. gracilenta; it is distinguished by the woody base that elevates the stems and basal leaves above the ground; the toothed margins on the basal leaves; and the mostly y-shaped hairs on the lower portions of the stems; and the seeds in one row per locule. Ethnobotany : Used to treat hiccoughs caused by dry throat; to counter the effects of a bad dream; and taken or made into a lotion to treat general body pain. Etymology : Boechera is named after Tyge Wittrock Boecher (1909-1983), born in Copenhagen, an authority on Arctic vegetation and the flora of Greenland who also worked in Argentina; perennans means perennial.

Ecology : Found on slopes in rich soil from 2,500-7,500 ft (762-2286 m); flowers March-November. Distribution : AZ, NM, UT, CO, TX Notes : This species is quite distinctive due to its large showy clusters of white, 4-petaled flowers; its tall upright growth form; and its abundant, long, slender seed pods which stick out in all directions from the stems and droop slightly because of how long they are. It resembles a white-flowered form of Prince's Plume (Stanleya pinnata). T. integrifolium differs by having sessile stem leaves (this species has leaves on petioles) and lower stem leaves that are entire, not pinnately lobed. T. laxiflorum has fewer flowers per raceme; shorter seed pods, 2-6 cm long; and the plants are often pubescent on the lower stems and leaves.

Deserts, chaparral, surrounding mountains, plains, sandy to rocky soils; 200-2100 m; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Kans., Nev., N.Mex., Okla., Tex., Utah; Mexico. Much of the material formerly assigned to varieties of Opuntia phaeacantha has been segregated as O. engelmannii . Various combinations of overlapping character states make separation of O. phaeacantha var. major from var. phaeacantha impractical. Presumably var. major comprises sprawling to erect shrubs with obovate stem segments bearing usually few darker colored spines (usually one to three) per areole, in the distal half of the stem segment or less, whereas plants of var. phaeacantha are trailing shrubs with narrowly obovate stem segments bearing more spines (usually three to ten) per areole throughout most to all of the stem segment. Recently some workers have applied O. camanchica Engelmann & Bigelow to those plants with the very dark colored spines and merged vars. major and phaeacantha . Distinctions among taxa are further blurred by hybridization of O. phaeacantha with O. engelmannii , yielding several named and unnamed hybrids, including O. wootonii Griffiths. Morphologic and genetic analyses of the populations are needed before correct names can be assigned to many of these plants with confidence. Opuntia phaeacantha also hybridizes with O. aureispina (forming O. ×spinosibacca ), O. ficus-indica , and O. littoralis (forming O. × vaseyi ), and members of the O. polyacantha complex, particularly near the regions of Grand Canyon and Four Corners.","JANAS 35(2) Plant : Shrubs decumbent to commonly trailing, 0.3-1 m tall.

Notes : This is a notoriously variable species within a notoriously confusing and much-hybridizing genus. Several former varieties were recently re-assigned to O. engelmannii, a species with which this taxon is known to hybridize. Distinguish O. phaeacantha by the usually sprawling, decumbent growth form; pads turning reddish (or occasionally purplish) after stress; dense glochids at each areole; the usually downward-pointing brown spines; flower petals that are yellow with reddish-peach bases or reddish throughout; and the fleshy fruits with skin the color of red wine and often greenish flesh if you cut them open. Distinguished from the similar O. engelmanii by the trailing growth form, usually smaller pads (15-40 cm long in O. engelmannii vs. 10-25 cm in this species), density of glochids, and the flower color (O. engelmannii has yellow to red flowers but not bicolored). Also similar to O. macrocentra, which shares the trait of bicolor yellow and red flower petals; distinguish from that species based on spine length (O. macrocentra can often have much longer spines, up to 17 cm long); and the spine shape, which is quite flattened in this species but mostly round in cross section with a slightly flattened base on O. macrocentra; O. macrocentra is also much more likely to have purple-tinted pads. Ethnobotany : The fruit is edible and is eaten fresh or dried, made into jams, jellies, juice and wine; pads are also edible and were prepared by roasting, boiling, or pulping and making into cakes; the seeds were ground into flour, although some say that prickly pear seeds are toxic and should not be eaten in quantity.

Notes : Look for this odd-smelling annual herb in wash bottoms at the low and middle elevations. The flowers are quite distinctive with 4 white petals and many long purple stamens which are longer than the petals and stick out of the flower. The long narrow seed pods are on nearly horizontal stalks, though the seed pods themselves point upwards. The leaves are in sets of 3 oval to oblong leaflets. Appears similar to P. uniglandulosa but that species is perennial; has more stamens per flower (20-30 stamens vs. 10-20 in P. dodecandra); usually has longer stamens (up to 5 cm, vs. 3 cm in P. dodecandra); and has larger flowers (petals 10-30 mm long, vs. petals 8-15 mm long in P. dodecandra). There are 3 subspecies of P. dodecandra: subsp. trachysperma is most common in the southwest. Subsp. dodecandra grows in the midwest and eastern US, but may occasionally occur in the southwest; it has smaller flowers, with petals only 3-8 mm long. Subsp. riograndensis is found in Texas and Mexico, and has pink, rose, or purple flowers. Ethnobotany : Pueblo tribes boil and eat the greens, and sometimes store them for winter use; Zuni use ceremonially. Etymology : Polanisia is from Greek polys, many, and anisos, unequal, referring to the many stamens of various lengths; dodecandra means 12 men, referring to the approximately 12 stamens in each flower.

Distribution : Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Notes : This strange parasitic plant looks like a yellowish-orange loosely constructed bird's nest on top of plants, sometimes growing large and covering the host plant, drying white and stiff, generally persistent even when desceased, stems when fresh with a slightly rubbery feel. Differs from C. salina in that C. californica has more flowers in its pannicle-like infloresences, C. salina also has umble-like infloresences, also C. salina has 1 seed per capsule, C. californica has 1-4. Other keys to this species are the lack of scales below the stamens, the triangular-ovate to lanceolate calyx lobes, lanceolate corolla lobes, and acute perianth parts. Kearney and Peebles describe this as an attractive species, easily recognizable bu its lanceolate, reflexed [to erect] corolla lobes, and lack of scalces below the stamens (infrastamineal).

Eleocharis rostellata is highly competitive, often forming large monospecific colonies.  The South American E. platypus C. B. Clarke is often treated as a synonym of E. rostellata. Eleocharis rostellata superfically closely resembles E. suksdorfiana in its culms, spikelets, and achenes, but differs in the absence of creeping rhizomes, presence of stoloniferous culms, absence of a flower in the proximal scale, and achene surface details.  The collection of E. rostellata I have seen from Miami-Dade County, Florida, is from 1877.  I have not seen vouchers for Archuleta County, Colorado, by H. D.

The secondary involucral bracts of Schoenoplectus americanus lack blades and closely resemble floral scales, in contrast to S. pungens and S. deltarum.   Although mostly very locally distributed, S. americanus is ecologically important in many coastal marshes.  In recent years it has seriously declined (e.g., in Maryland and Louisiana).  It may occur in southwestern Kansas; I have not seen a specimen.  It probably has been extirpated from the Missouri station, based on one collection from 1886 (G. Yatskievych, pers. comm.).  The report from New Hampshire is based on M. L. Fernald (1950).  The stations on the Maine and Connecticut coasts, at Lake Champlain in Vermont, and in Oklahoma are based on putative S. americanus × S. pungens specimens.  Some plants in the southwest are atypical in having nearly flat culm sides and leaf blades to 1.5 times as long as their sheaths as in the type of Scirpus monophyllus J. Presl & C. Presl from Peru.  The name Scirpes americanus was long misapplied to Schoenoplectus pungens; Schoenoplectus americanus was known as Scirpus olneyi (A. E. Schuyler 1974).",,"Cronquist et al. 1977, Martin and Hutchins 1980, Kearney and Peebles 1969, Heil et al 2013, FNA 2003, Allred and Ivey 2012, Rink and Licher in prep (draft for NM Flora) Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Graminoid General : Perennial rush-like herb, 50-150 cm tall, from robust rhizomes; stems loosely clustered or scattered, stout, 5-10 mm thick at the base, sharply triangular, the angles ridged or winged and the sides conspicuously concave. Vegetative : Leaves commonly 1-4 per stem, borne on the lower 1/3 of the stem; lower leaves reduced to blade-less sheaths wrapped around the stem; upper leaves with blades usually less than 10 cm long, strongly folded, 6 mm wide when dried, gradually tapered to a poin Inflorescence : Inflorescence a dense cluster of 2-5 sessile spikelets near the top of the stem, emerging at the base of a green bract that points straight up and appears to be a continuation of the stem; bract 1-5 cm long, with a pointed tip. Spikelets 6-15 mm long, each spikelet consisting of many small spirally arranged flowers, each subtended by a scale; scales yellowish-brown, red-brown, or purplish-brown, and hyaline (papery-textured), with a small notch at the tip and a firm midrib that extends into the notch as a short straight awn. Each scale (flower) produces a single seed; seeds plano-convex, 2-3 mm long. Ecology : Found in wet soils, especially in marshes and meadows from 3,500-8,000 ft (1067-2438 m); flowers June-September. Distribution : Most of the US except the midwest; south through MEX to S. Amer.; also in Europe. Notes : This species is quite similar to Schoenoplectus pungens, and for a time the two species were lumped under the name S. americanus. However, they are currently accepted to be separate taxa. S. americanus is a larger, more robust plant with a more southerly distribution, although the two species can certainly grow side by side. S. americanus has sharply three-sided stems with ridged or winged angles and concave sides, while S. pungens has 3-sided stems that are less sharply triangular, the sides are not concave, and the angles are never winged. Also, use your hand lens to look closely at the flower spikes: each individual flower is subtended by a brown scale. On S. americanus, the scales are shallowly notched at the tip, with a short awn emerging from the notch (notch less than 0.5 mm deep and awn less than 0.6 mm long). On S. pungens, the notches are deeper and the awn emerging from the notch is longer (notch greater than 0.5 mm deep and awn greater than 0.5 mm long.) Ethnobotany : Used as a hair tonic; the roots and shoots were eaten and used for basketry, hats, and other kinds of weaving.

Leaves : Opposite along the stems, on short slender petioles upto 1 mm long; blades obovate-elliptic to oblong, 3-11 mm long and 3-5 mm wide, with a slightly asymmetric base; margin usually obscurely serrate near the leaf tip; upper leaf surface nearly hairless and lower surface usually short-villous. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In E. prostrata, the cyathia (flower structures) are solitary or clustered in leaf axils near branch tips, or on congested axillary branches. Involucres are cone-shaped, less than 1 mm high, and crisped-villous or glabrous, with 4 reddish, oval-shaped glands around the edge, each with a rudamentary white to pink petaloid appendage; 3-6 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsules broadly ovoid, 3-celled, 1-2 mm long, crisped-villous along the angles and near the base; containing 3 whitish ovoid seeds, 1 mm long, sharply 4-angled in cross section, with several narrow, sharp, slightly irregular, transverse ridges. Ecology : Found in disturbed areas, especially in sandy soil, from 1,500-4,000 ft (457-1219 m); flowers March-October. Distribution : Most of the U.S., except for OR, WA, east to MI; south through S. Amer.; throughout the world on every continent. Notes : This species belongs to the Chamaesyce subgenus of Euphorbia. Some treatments, even recent ones, continue to treat Chamaesyce as a separate genus even though molecular evidence places it within Euphorbia. Chamaesyce spp are distinct based on their leaves which are always opposite and and often have asymmetric bases; cyathia (flower structures) in leaf axils, not at branch tips, and usually with petaloid appendages; and stipules present and not gland-like. E. prostrata is distinguished by being a mostly prostrate annual with spreading or appressed hairs all over; minutely serrate, ovate leaves, 3-11 mm long; few, small cyathia (inflorescences that resemble flowers) grouped between leaves along the stems; reddish glands on the cyathia with petaloid appendages very small to absent; seed pods with spreading, crisped or crinkly hairs mostly bunched along the angles; and sharp ridges across the seeds. Could be confused with C. abramsiana or C. micromera: distinguished by the usually larger, broader leaves (not serrate in micromera), pubescent capsule margins, and smaller seeds with sharper ridges. It is wise to make a collection whenever ID to species is needed, as Chamaesyces are difficult to identify in the field, and multiple species of the genus will commonly grow side-by-side.

Leaves : Alternate and pinnately compound, 1-15 cm long, with 7-25 leaflets per leaf; leaflets linear to widely ovate, 2-23 mm long and 1-13 mm wide, with entire margins, pubescent to glabrous on one or both sides; stipules discinct, 1-7 mm long or more. Flowers : Pink, purple, white, or cream-colored, in terminal racemes 1-18 cm long, with the flowers pointing upward or downward at maturity; flowers 1-2 cm long, with pea-flower morphology (papilionaceous), with a wide upper petal called the banner, two smaller lateral petals called the wings, and a boat-shaped lower petal called the keel which contains the style and stamens. Petals pink-purple, cream-colored, whitish, or variously suffused with pink or purple; sepals 5, strigose, united into a tube 3-9 mm long, topped with 5 narrow teeth, 6-25 mm long. Fruits : Pods ascending (pointing upward) to declined (pointing downward), variable in shape: inflated and ovoid or not inflated and oblong, 12-26 mm long and 3-20 mm wide, topped with a triangular beak, strigose or glabrous, mottled or not, leathery to membraneou Ecology : Found in a variety of xeric upland communities, from 200-7,000 ft (61-2134 m); flowers February-June. Distribution : Western N. Amer., from B.C., CAN, WA and MT, south to CA, AZ, NM, and MEX. Notes : Astragalus is an exceptionally large genus and it is wise to make a good collection with flowers and mature seed pods-- especially seed pods-- for identification. A. lentiginosus is identified by this combination of traits: short lived perennial with ascending to decumbent stems; stems and leaves can be hairy or glabrous, but the hairs are never particularly dense; pinnately compound leaves with 7-25 leaflets and distinct (not fused) stipules; seed pods of various shapes but always bilocular (cut it in half cross-wise and there are 2 chambers), and without a stipe (stalk at the base of the pod but above where the calyx attached) or only a short stipe, to 1 mm long; and flowers 8-21 mm long, which can be white, cream, pink, or purple. There are over 50 varieties of A. lentiginosus, which is why the species description is a bit vague. Var. diphysus is a  variety commonly found throughout central and northern Arizona and New Mexico (Allred calls it var. albiflorus); it has usually pink-purple, relatively large flowers, with the keel petal 11-15 mm long; and strongly inflated, ovoid seed pods with a triangular beak at the tip; the pod color can be green-, red-, or purple-tinged, or brightly mottled. Ethnobotany : The Zuni people eat the pods of the diphysus variety fresh, boiled, or salted. They are also dried and stored for winter use Etymology : Astragalus comes from the Greek astragalos, ankle bone, an early name applied to some plants in this family because of the shape of the seeds; lentiginosus means freckled or spotted, alluding to the often mottled seed pods.

Distribution : c CA, s NV, UT, AZ, NM, s TX; south to n MEX. Notes : A distinct herb, densely glandular-hairy all over; with large ovate leaves; especially distinct are the snapdragon-esque pink flowers which resemble an open mouth with a yellow nectar guide inside; also unmistakable are the devils-claw fruits, which, when young, are wet-glandular, have a rank smell, and vaguely resemble green chiles, and when mature are hard, woody and split into two claws. Distinguished from other species in the genus by being annual (P. althaeifolia is perennial) and not having spots or blotches on the inside of the corolla tube, or if there are any blotches of color inside the corolla tube, they are on the lower surface. There are two varieties in the US. Var. parviflora is the wild type, with black seeds. Var. hohokamiana is the descendent of a strain that was cultivated by the Hohokam for basketry fiber, and has white seeds and larger fruit. Once classified in the sesame family, Pedaliaceae, it is classidied as Martyniaceae under APG IV. Ethnobotany : Widely eaten, both seeds and fruit. When young, fruit is similar to okra. Mature fruit used for basketry fiber. Etymology : Proboscidea is from Greek proboskis, elephant's trunk; parviflora mean small-flowered.

A cladistic analysis of chloroplast ndh F sequence data (W. L. Applequist and R. S. Wallace 2001) indicated that Phemeranthus aurantiacus belongs in the same clade as Talinum paniculatum (Jacquin) Gaertner and the two other species of that genus that were sampled, rather than in a separate and rather distant clade containing P. mengesii , the only other species of Phemeranthus included in the study. The molecular evidence, together with the planate leaves and extended stem of P. aurantiacus , which are anomalous in Phemeranthus , suggest that perhaps this species should be restored to Talinum . However, in fruit and seed characters, the chief morphological bases on which Talinum and Phemeranthus are distinguished, P. aurantiacus clearly belongs in the latter. Talinum angustissimum often has been held separate from Phemeranthus aurantiacus ( T. aurantiacum ), but the supposed distinctions break down in a continuum of intergradation, the other extreme of which was described as T. whitei . The former extreme, centered in southern Arizona, has yellow petals, very narrow leaves, slender stems, and small, globose capsules; the latter, centered in southern Chihuahua and northern Durango, has orange to reddish petals, broad leaves, stout stems, and large, ovoid capsules. The name T. lineare Kunth, which properly applies to a species from central Mexico, has been misapplied to some collections of P. aurantiacus from Texas.","CANOTIA 2(1) PLANT : Herbs to 5 dm tall.

Flowers : Spicate inflorescence, hypanthium 20-30 mm long, globose at base, narrowing to tube, 4 erect sepals, lanceolate, 8-10 mm long; petals 2-cleft, scarlet, 8-15 mm long, tube bearing 8 appendages within, 4 erect and 4 deflexed. Fruits : Capsule, 15-20 mm long, often curved. Ecology : Found on dry slopes to wet soils from 4,000-7,000 ft (1372-2134 m); flowers June-October. Notes : The tall slender stems and opposite leaves will make you think Penstemon, but pay attention to the way the flowers attach, especially with their different ovary. There are two subspecies: subsp. latifolium and subsp. angustifolium. The former is more widespread through the intermountain west, while the latter has been collected in many fewer locations. They are not well distinguished in the literature, so a collection is recommended. This description is drawn primarily from prior descriptions of subsp. latifolium. Ethnobotany : Used for infected sores, for fever in children, as a general remedy, for urinary problems, hemorrhages, as a cathartic, kidney troubles, tuberculosis, syphilis, and sucked for the nectar. Etymology : Epilobium comes from Greek epi, meaning upon and lobos, meaning a pod or capsule, while canum means off-white, or ashy.

During enlargement and maturation of the fruit of Rivina humilis , the two inner cell layers of the pericarp become separated from the outer layers. The cells of the outermost two layers elongate centrifugally, eventually forming tubular trichomes 133-229 µm long. These two layers become appressed and adherent to the seed coat; thus the seed appears to be, and is sometimes described as, pubescent (J. W. Thieret 1966b). The outer layers of the pericarp differentiate into the juicy portion of the fruit (L. B. Kajale 1954; D. D. Nautiyal and S. C. Gupta 1984). Rivina humilis is cultivated as a greenhouse plant or, in warm areas, as a garden ornamental.

Two of the three grow in the Flora region; the third, B. curtipendula var. tenuis , is endemic to Mexico.",,"FNA 2003 Common Name : sideoats grama Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Graminoid General : Large, often- rhizomatous perennial grass, can be tufted or not; stems erect or decumbent, 8-100 cm, solitary or in small to large groups, elliptical-round in cross section, rarely branched; fibrous roots and long or short rhizomes. Vegetative : Blades evenly distributed along culm, flat or folded when dry, long, drooping, rough above, 2-7 mm wide, 2-30 cm long, with pustular-based hairs on margin of blade near collar; sheath with papery margin, open and rounded; ligule thin and translucent, truncate, irregularly toothed, 0.2-0.6 mm long, collar with hairy margin and occasionally glandular. Inflorescence : Panicle with 20-50 short (1-3 cm), deciduous spicate branches that hang off main inflorescence stem; branches with 2-7 short awned spikelets; spikelets with 1 perfect floret and 1 rudimentary floret; glumes unequal, lower glume half as long as upper glume, upper glume as broad and long as lemma, lemma 4-7 mm; palea slightly shorter than lemma; usually short awns on glumes and lemmas; anthers red to yellow. Ecology :  Found in open grasslands, limestone outcrops, rocky slopes, woodlands and forest openings from 2,500-7,000 ft (762-2134 m); flowers June-November. Distribution : Much of N. America, especially common in the Great Plains and Southwest; from Canada south through Mexico to western S. America. Notes : Side-oats gramma is a descriptive common name due to the inflorescence which has 20-50 small branches, each with 2-7 spikelets(these can appear as clusters of spikelets at first and not branches) which dangle off of one side of the inflorescence axis. The small branches are deciduous, and leave a narrow zig-zag pattern with small nodules where they have detached. It is a perennial with leaf-blades 2-7 mm wide and flat, not rolled. This is a quite common species, being widespread and often abundant where it occurs. There are two varieties in Arizona: var. curtipendula and var. caespitosa. Var. curtipendula can be distinguished by being long-rhizomatous, with stems solitary or in small clumps. Var. caespitosa are not long-rhizomatous, though the bases are sometimes knotty with short rhizomes, and stems are in large or small clumps. A third variety, var. tenuis is endemic to Mexico, but a single collection has been made in the Huachuca Mountains. This variety does not have very long rhizomes, and has conspicuously curled blades.

sites, such as overgrazed rangelands, fields, sand dunes, road verges, and
waste places. It is highly competitive and dominates rapidly after fire,
especially in sagebrush areas. The resulting dense, fine fuels permanently
shorten the fire-return interval, further hindering reestablishment of native
species. It now dominates large areas of the sagebrush ecosystem of the western Flora region. See Schachnet et al. 2008 discuss the population genetics of this species in the midcontinental United States and cite earlier papers on a similar topic for other parts of the country. In the southwestern
United States, Bromus tectorum is
considered a good source of spring feed for cattle, at least until the awns
mature. Specimens with glabrous spikelets have been called Bromus tectorum forma nudus (Klett & Richt.) H. St. John. They occur throughout the
range of the species, and are not known to have any other distinguishing
characteristics. For this reason, they are not given formal recognition in this

 Australia. Numerous infraspecific taxa have been recognized in the past, but 
 none appears to be justified. Recent North American accounts of Distichlis have usually recognized plants from maritime coasts as distinct from those 
 growing inland, supposedly having more congested inflorescences, but the range 
 of variation is similar in the two habitats. López Soto et al. (2009) examined the leaf anatomy of six species and 11 varieties of Distichlis. They found that D. australis and D. palmeri differed from all other species and that D. humilis, D. spicata, and D. scoparia were anatomically similar but distinguishable. They found no characters or character combinations that supported recognition of infraspecific taxa within D. spicata. Harrington et al. (2009), on the other hand, found that inland plants, which Rydberg called D. stricta, differed from coastal plants in molecularly, cytogenetically, and in their phenology. On that basis, it seems that treatment of the inland plants as D. spicata subsp. stricta (Torr.) Thorne is warranted. The reason for no treating them as species is pragmatic, the lack of morphological characters for distinguishing them. Plants with long, wiry stolons. Culms 8-15 cm, clustered, erect, with numerous short, leafy, lateral branches. Leaves clustered on distant to closely-spaced, short, lateral shoots; sheaths 4-6 mm, rounded, smooth, shiny, glabrous or puberulent at the base; ligules thickly membranous ciliate rims; blades 0.5-1.5 cm long, 1-2(3) mm wide, stiff, subulate, uniformly many-veined. Inflorescences terminal, composed of a single glabrous spikelet, this enclosed, and almost concealed, by the uppermost leaf sheaths.

Anthesis from late May to July. 2 n = 28. Elymus elymoides grows in dry, often rocky, open woods, thickets, grasslands, and disturbed areas, from sagebrush deserts to alpine tundra. It is widespread in western North America, from  British Columbia to northern Mexico and the western Great Plains, and introduced in western  Missouri,  Illinois, and   Kentucky. It is often dominant in overgrazed pinyon-juniper woodlands. Although palatable early in the season, the disarticulating, long-awned spikes irritate grazing animals later in the year. Elymus elymoides intergrades with E. multisetus -in parts of its southern range (   Wilson 1963). It is sometimes confused with E. scribneri , but differs in having more than one spikelet per node, narrower glumes, and less tardily disarticulating rachises. Hybrids with several other species in the Triticeae -are known; they can often be recognized by their tardily disarticulating rachises. Named interspecific hybrids (and the other parent) are E. - saundersii -( E. trachycaulus ), E. - pinaloensis -( E. arizonicus ), and possibly E. - hansenii -( E. elymoides or E. multisetus -- E. glaucus ). Hybrids with E. sierrae -have not been named; they are common where the two species are sympatric. They have broader glume bases, shorter glume awns, and longer anthers than E. elymoides .",,"FNA 2007, Gould 1980 Common Name : squirreltail Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Graminoid General : Annual bunchgrass with erect, geniculate, or slightly decumbent stems, often glaucous, 8-65 cm tall; nodes 4-6 per culm, glabrous and mostly concealed.

Ecology : Dry, often rocky, but wide-ranging habitats from open woods to grasslands to disturbed areas from 2,000-11,500 ft (610-3505 m), flowers March-August. Distribution : Widespread in western N. America from s CAN to n MEX. Notes : Distinctive as a perennial bunchgrass possessing an inflorescence of spikelets, (usually) two at each node and stacked up the axis, with very long awns that curve outward when dry, making the entire inflorescence resemble a bottlebrush. Considered one of the most fire resistant of all native bunchgrasses and provides good forage. E. elymoides is an incredibly common forest and woodland understory species in Arizona; Flora Neomexicana (2012) and the Four Corners Flora (2013) consider it to not occur in New Mexico, giving their local counterpart the name Elymus longifolius. E. longifolius is distinguished from E. elymoides based on the first floret in each spikelet being well developed and fertile. (In E. elymoides the first floret in at least one spikelet per node is reduced to an awn.) However, Flora of North America considers the New Mexican species E. longiflorus to be synonymous with E. elymoides subsp. brevifolius, which is why it is treated as E. elymoides here. Ethnobotany : Used as forage, although the awns on mature fruits irritate animals' mouths. Etymology : Elymus comes form Greek name elymos for millet, while elymoides means like the genus Elymus.

Eriogonum abertianum is widespread and common to abundant or even locally weedy. It is basically a species of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts, ranging from San Luis Potosí and Sonora in northern Mexico to western Texas and much of New Mexico and Arizona. This species is exceedingly variable and can be differentiated into several geographic and seasonal phases (C. C. Baskin et al. 1993; G. A. Fox 1989, 1990, 1990b). Variety abertianum (including E. pinetorum ) is a more northern and western, summer- and fall-flowering expression, with an erect habit and a cymose-paniculate inflorescence when the plants are in fruit. A vernal phase (var. villosum ) of this northern form occurs throughout much of the same range (mainly Arizona, New Mexico, and the Sonoran Desert of Mexico). It is a hairier and more spreading expression, with elongated inflorescence branches bearing more floriferous involucres. Variety ruberrimum (including E. cyclosepalum ) is the more southern, summer- to fall-flowering expression (mainly New Mexico, Texas, and the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico) with a prostrate to spreading, compact habit and a racemose inflorescence at full maturity. There is a vernal expression of this as well; it differs from the vernal form of var. abertianum in having longer peduncles. There are no sharp morphologic or geographic boundaries for any of these expressions, and while the fruiting extremes are clearly distinguishable, far too many specimens are impossible to place satisfactorily. The Navajo (Diné) people use these plants as a lotion for both themselves and their horses (P. A. Vestal 1952).",,"Wiggins 1964, Kearney and Peebles 1969, FNA 2005 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual herb, 5-60 cm tall; stems erect or spreading, profusely branched from near the base, green or grayish to reddish, appressed-hirsute.

Flowers : White to pink, arranged in tight rounded clusters of several flowers held together by a cup-shaped structure called an involucre; involucres arranged in open cymose inflorescenses, these up to 50 cm wide and long, with hairy branches; each individual flower is 3-4 mm high, with 6 ruffled, papery, petal-like tepals, these white to pale yellow and often tinted with rose, with deep-rose colored midribs. Fruits : Achenes lens-shaped, less than 1 mm long, dark brown and smooth or transversely rugulose (wrinkled). Ecology : Found on sandy plains, washes, and granitic hills, from 1,500-7000 ft (457-2134 m); flowers March-September. Distribution : AZ, NM, TX; south to n MEX. Notes : One of our most common annual buckwheats with several varieties known. It is annual and can be variable in growth form, as erect and branching above, or small with few stems from a basal rosette, or prostrate and spreading; the leaves are oval-shaped, with long, shaggy hairs and wavy margins and are smaller higher up the stem. Immediately obvious (in some populations) are the inflorescences which are often round balls of white flowers with red stripes down the center of each petal and many yellow stamens in the centers; the inflorescences can also be elongated on some. Ethnobotany : Navajo used it to make a lotion for skin cuts on humans and horses. Etymology : Eriogonum is from the Greek erion, wool, and gony, knee, alluding to the hairy nodes of the first species described, E. tomentosum; abertiaum is named for James William Abert (1820-1897), a US Army officer who led exploratory expeditions in the American West.

In the nonflowering condition, Portulaca suffrutescens resembles P. pilosa , although P. suffrutescens is stiffly erect. Another characteristic of this species is elongation of the internodes such that the overall impression of density of trichomes appears to be less than in P. pilosa . This feature will not be apparent in immature plants, or in those growing in dry conditions in which little internode elongation may have taken place. Immature seeds appear black, with rounded tubercles on the abaxial spine.","CANOTIA 2(1) PLANT : Perennial herb from tuberous thickened rootstocks.

Ecology : Found in canyons, on shady and open slopes from 3,500-9,000 ft (1067-2743 m); flowers May-June. Notes : This is a large shrub with leaves in 3's; whitish flowers that resemble orange blossoms (they are in the same family); and dry, winged fruits similar to ash or maple fruits but flat and round. When the leaves are held up to the light, you will notice many delicate punctations or tiny glands on the surface. Crush the leaves to release a strong citrus-y scent. Can be confused with velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina) because of the 3-foliate leaves, but that species lacks the scented glands and has opposite leaves (look at where each set of 3 leaflets attaches to the branch).

Ecology : Found in wet, usually alkaline soils, along streams and in wet meadows, often growing in large colonies, from 1,000-6,000 ft (305-1829 m); flowers April-October. Distribution : s OR, CA, NV, UT, AZ, CO, NE, KS, OK, TX; south to c MEX. Notes : Distinctive especially when in flower, this species forms showy flower displays which rise from a dense groundcover of leaf clusters emerging from rhizomes. The compact conic flower spike subtended by the beautiful white to reddish bracts is very distinctive, especially when combined with the generally large colony and the wet habitat in which you'll find this species. Ethnobotany : Yerba mansa is well known for its medicinal uses, including external use on sores, burns, as disinfectant for cuts, and as a wash for sore feet and muscles; also used internally for stomach ulcers, colds, coughs, menstrual cramps, diabetes, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and syphilis; it's been used as a laxative and an emetic; and the seeds were made into mush and eaten. Etymology : Anemopsis alludes to Anenome, a genus of similar-appearing plants in the ranunculus family (Ranunculaceae); californica means of or from California.

Stems erect, rarely ascending or prostrate, profusely branched from or near base (rarely simple in underdeveloped specimens); branches straight or arcuate. Leaves alternate; blade filiform to narrowly linear, usually less than 1 mm wide, occasionally to 2 mm wide in herbarium specimens, fleshy or not, not swollen at base, apex subspinose or spinescent. Inflorescences distinctly interrupted at maturity, 1-flowered (rarely 2-3-flowered with lateral flowers mostly abortive); bracts alternate, not imbricate, strongly reflexed at maturity, base not distinctly swollen, narrowing into spinose apex. Flowers: bracteoles spreading or reflexed, distinct or connate near base, spinescent; perianth segments prominently winged (two wings usually reduced to small, almost subulate winglike appendages, apex long-acuminate or long-subulate and spinose, forming slender columnar beak distal to wings at maturity, glabrous; fruiting perianth 7-12 mm diam. 2 n = 36. Flowering spring-summer. Sandy soils, disturbed natural and seminatural plant communities, semideserts, deserts, eroded slopes, sand dunes, sandy waste places; 0-1900 m; introduced; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Nev., Utah; se Europe; c Asia. Salsola paulsenii may be expected in the future also in New Mexico and Texas, as well as in some Great Plains states. It was first reported from North America by P. A. Munz (1968). Additional details of distribution and morphology of this species have been discussed by J. C. Beatley (1973c), T. C. Fuller (1986), and S. Rilke (1999). Salsola paulsenii is weakly differentiated from S. tragus sensu stricto. Intermediate forms between them seem to be more common along margins of the natural range of the species and in secondary, synanthropic localities. According to S. Rilke (1999), the hybrids S. paulsenii × S. tragus are identical with S. × gobicola Iljin. Forms conventionally named as ' Salsola X' and ' S. paulsenii lax form' with 2 n = 54 (H. L. Arnold 1972; F. J. Ryan and D. R. Ayres 2000) are probably also of hybrid origin. Reports of chromosome number 2 n = 18 for Salsola paulsenii are probably erroneous and based on misinterpretation of data provided by N. L. Semiotrocheva (1983).",,,Salsola paulsenii,AMARANTHACEAE,annual,non-native,0,herb,0.0,1900.0

Notes : Lemna is a genus of tiny, free-floating aquatic plants, which usually form loose mats or clusters of very small (ca. 2-3 mm) -leaves- that float on the water surface, with trailing roots that are thin, transparent, and not attached to the ground. L. gibba is distinguished from other Lemma spp. by having 3-5(7) veins on the leaves and roots greater than 3 cm long; it is separated from L. minor by the red color on the lower surface of the leaves, which begins along the margin. Identification of species within this genus is tricky and requires high magnification and technical knowledge of the group. To analyze anatomic structures (e.g., number of veins or extension of air spaces), transparent slides are necessary. Ethnobotany : Unknown Etymology : Lemna is from the Greek limnos, lake or swamp, while gibba means swollen on one side.

Distribution : w TX to AZ; south to MEX Notes : Here is another yellow-flowered Asteraceae shrub. It is quite common and widespread throughout New Mexico, especially the central, southern and eastern parts of the state, and found at the middle elevations in Arizona as well. It could be easily confused with its congener, Isocoma rusbyi. I rusbyi has larger flower heads, with involucres 6-10 mm high and 5-8 mm wide, and more florets, 19-25 per flower head (I. pluriflora's involucres are 4-5 mm high and 3-5 mm wide and there are 7-15 florets per head). I rusbyi is also less resinous than this species. I. pluriflora could also be mistaken for the common, widespread, and incredibly variable Ericameria nauseosa. The keys to that species are its densely tomentose stems and longer, narrower flower heads (involucres 6-16 mm long and only 2-4 mm wide). I. pluriflora is an invader of depleted rangeland and old fields. Ethnobotany : Used as a lotion to heal infant's navel; a poultice was applied for muscular pain; leaves were chewed for coughs. Etymology : Isocoma is from Greek iso- for equal and coma, hair of the head, referring to the flat-topped inflorences; pluriflora means many-flowered.

The leaves are distinctive, being gray-green, hairy especially on the lower surface, and triangular or narrower with a tapered base and usually teeth around the edge. There are two subspecies: subsp. exauriculata is most common in the American West, and has petioles that are not auriculate-dilated at the base. Ssp. encelioides is native to the Gulf Coast and has more prominently auriculate petioles and mostly longer involucral bracts. There are several other species of Verbesina in the southwest but they are perennial. Host plant for Bordered patch butterfly.

Coastal side of mountains, cliffs and dry hillsides; 0-1500 m; Calif.; Mexico (Baja California). Dudleya pulverulenta is one of the largest and most distinctive species of the genus, easily recognized from a distance, even without flowers. All parts of the flowering shoot often are farinose. It has the widest range of any dudleya, over 1000 kilometers, from Monterey County to the Sierra San Borja in north-central Baja California. It is a beautiful plant, much admired but less easily grown than some others. Hummingbirds often visit Dudleya pulverulenta , hovering beneath the pendent flowers and thrusting their bills up into them for nectar. The species shows a syndrome of traits that K. A. Grant and V. Grant (1968) found in hummingbird-pollinated plants of western North America: open inflorescence; pendent flowers on long, slender pedicels; long red corolla with long tube; and (as shown by G. A. Levin and T. W. Mulroy 1985) high nectar yield. Although hummingbirds also visit other species of the genus, this one seems especially adapted to them as pollinators, having, for example, about the longest corolla, with the longest tube, and the highest nectar output. While most other dudleyas have flowers erect along the adaxial side of the cincinnal branch, here the young branch twists at the base, putting the flowers on the abaxial or outer side, where they are declined or pendent. After flowering, each pedicel bends sharply to bring the fruit erect, as it is in other species. This syndrome is nearly unique to D. pulverulenta and the related D. anthonyi , of northern Baja California, although variously approached in forms of the related and intergrading D. arizonica .",,,Dudleya pulverulenta,CRASSULACEAE,perennial,native,0,succulent,0.0,1500.0

Cyperus strigosus is usually among the more common Cyperus species throughout its range.  Small individuals flowering the first year may be difficult to distinguish from C. polystachyos, C. odoratus, C. erythrorhizos, and C. esculentus, which may be sympatric. Cyperus strigosus has trigonous achenes and three stigmas, unlike C. polystachyos; C. strigosus has flattened spikelets, unlike the subcylindric ones of C. odoratus; C.  strigosus has floral scales usually 3 mm or more, unlike the smaller (1.2-1.5 mm) ones of C. erythrorhizos; C. strigosus has deciduous floral scales and a cormlike stem base with stolons, unlike C. esculentus. Cyperus strigosus appears to be closely related to the neotropical C. camphoratus Liebmann; both species have deciduous floral scales and deciduous spikelets (G. C. Tucker 1994).  Plants segregated as C. stenolepis cannot be distinguished consistently from C. strigosus on any single charcter, rather they appear to be merely large individuals of C. strigosus with long floral scales and frequently septate inflorescence bracts (M. L. Horvat 1941).",,,Cyperus strigosus,CYPERACEAE,perennial,native,1,grass,0.0,1500.0

Leaves : Opposite along the stems, on petioles less than 1 mm long; blades orbicular to oblong, 3-8 mm long, with a strongly asymmetric base and entire margins, often with a red blotch in the center; stipules united into a membranous, white, triangular or ovate scale, about 1 mm long. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In E. albomarginata, the cyathia (modified flowers) are solitary in the leaf axils. Involucres are bell-shaped, and 1 mm high, and glabrous, with 4 green-yellow to red oblong glands around the edge, each with a conspicuous white to pink petaloid appendage which often has a toothed edge; 15-30 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsule 3-chambered, broadly ovoid, 2 mm long, glabrous, the angles acute; seeds 4-sided, oblong, smooth and whitish, 1-2 mm long. Ecology : Found in open, sandy or gravelly dry places up through the pinon-juniper zone, from 1,000-7,000 ft (305-2135 m); flowers April-September. Distribution : s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, NM, TX, OK; south to c MEX. Notes : This species belongs to the Chamaesyce subgenus of Euphorbia. Some treatments, even recent ones, treat Chamaesyce as a separate genus even though molecular evidence places it within Euphorbia. Chamaesyce spp are distinct based on their leaves which are always opposite and and often have asymmetric bases; cyathia (flower structures) in leaf axils, not at branch tips, and usually with petaloid appendages; and stipules present and not gland-like. E. albomarginata is a common and widespread species in the west, distinguished by being a prostrate perennial without any hairs on the stems, leaves, or seed pods; the cyathia (modified flowers) with large white petaloid appendages (look like petals); and stipules that unite to form a white papery scale between the leaf pairs where they attach to the stem (in other species there is a separate stipule at the base of each petiole). The FNA treatment states that the leaves have white margins (hence the specific epithet) but this trait is not particularly obvious on most specimens. It is wise to make a collection whenever ID to species is needed, as Chamaesyces are difficult to identify in the field, and multiple species of the genus will commonly grow side-by-side. Ethnobotany : Diegueno brew plant into tea to treat sores. Shoshoni and Kawaitsu use leaves and flowers for snakebite. Keres treat eye problems by rub from plant. Navajo use slow tea from whole plant for colds or stomachaches. Etymology : Euphorbia is named for Euphorbus, Greek physician of Juba II, King of Mauretania, while albomarginata refers to white margins.

Flowering late spring-early fall. Dry, open hillsides of igneous rock, shrubs, pinyon-juniper or mixed conifer woodlands; 1200-2000 m; Ariz., Calif., N.Mex.; Mexico (Sonora). Mirabilis coccinea is easily confused with M. linearis var. linearis when the flowers are closed. The distinction is more difficult when plants are cleistogamous (phase Allionia gracillima in M. coccinea ; phases A. pinetorum and Oxybaphus bodinii in M. linearis ). In general, leaves of M. coccinea are oriented at an angle of 45° or greater to the stem, the distal portion of the main axis of the inflorescence is glabrous to 2-3 cm from the flowers, and the peduncles are sparingly short pubescent. In var. linearis , the leaves are generally oriented at 45° or less to the stem, the inflorescence is densely pubescent, and the peduncles are densely spreading-pubescent. Reports of the occurrence of M. coccinea in Texas (e.g., D. S. Correll and M. C. Johnston 1970) are apparently based on literature records and perhaps on a labeling error of a probable isotype collected by Charles Wright. No specimens have been seen from Texas. P. C.

 India before 2500 B.C., and became an important crop in China after the Mongolian 
 conquest. It was introduced to the Western Hemisphere in the early sixteenth 
 century, and is now an important crop in the United States and Mexico. Numerous 
 cultivated strains exist, some of which have been formally named. They are all 
 interfertile with each other and with other wild species of Sorghum . The treatment presented here is based on de Wet (1978) and is somewhat artificial. Sorghum bicolor subsp. arundinaceum is the wild progenitor of the cultivated strains, all of which are treated 
 as S. bicolor subsp. bicolor . 
 These strains tend to lose their distinguishing characteristics if left to themselves. 
 They will also hybridize with subsp. arundinaceum , and these hybrids 
 can backcross to either parent, resulting in plants that may strongly resemble 
 one parent while having some characteristics of the other. All such hybrids 
 and backcrosses are treated here as S. bicolor subsp. drummondii .",,"FNA 2007, Gould 1980 Common Name : sorghum Duration : Annual Nativity : Non-Native Lifeform : Graminoid General : Robust annual, stems 1-3 m tall.

Rumex dentatus , belonging to subsect. Dentati Rechinger f. (K. H. Rechinger 1937), is an extremely variable species. In Eurasia and northern Africa it is represented by several distinct races, usually regarded as subspecies. Rechinger reported from North America (California and Oregon, mostly as a casual alien occuring in ballast grounds) only subsp. klotzschianus (Meisner) Rechinger f., which is native in southern and eastern Asia (China, India, Japan, Korea). J. E. Dawson (1979) also regarded this as the most common subspecies in North America. However, I believe most North American representatives of this aggregate belong to subsp. halacsyi (Rechinger f.) Rechinger f., which is native in the eastern Mediterranean region (Asia Minor), the Caucasus, southeastern Europe, and western and central Asia. This subspecies, sometimes recognized as R. halacsyi Rechinger f., differs from subsp. klotzschianus by its broader triangular (not rounded) inner tepals and longer teeth (to 3 mm). Unfortunately, subspecies of R. dentatus still are insufficiently understood even in Eurasia.

Amer.; also in Afrca, Europe, Asia and Australia. Notes : Silver-leaf nightshade is a common and widespread species which florishes in disturbed habitats, especially where grazing pressure is high, as it is toxic to livestock. Look for the dark purple flowers with bright yellow stamens; the flower structure should look familiar, as it is the same as the flowers on the tomato plants in your garden (these are also in the genus Solanum). The leaves are silvery and oblong, and there are fine yellowish spines all along the stems and on the underside of many leaves, mostly along the midveins. Occasionally a white-flowered form is seen; this is known as forma albiflorum Ethnobotany : Considered to be highly toxic. In the American Southwest a preparation of S. elaeagnifolium was used in treating ear, nose, and throat ailments, as well as eye infections and toothaches.

Some extremes of Parietaria pensylvanica with short, oblong or ovate leaf blades strongly resemble P . hespera var. hespera . Parietaria hespera is usually more delicate and has thinner leaves with the proximal pair of lateral veins arising at the junction of blade and petiole. Leaf shape and texture tend to overlap in the two species, but in P . pensylvanica the proximal pair of lateral veins clearly arise above the junction of blade and petiole. The extremes of P . pensylvanica frequently are found where the ranges of the two species approach or overlap. Examples of these intermediates are from Gila, Mohave, and Yuma counties, Arizona. A mixed collection from Rock Springs, Gila County, Arizona, suggests that the two species occasionally grow together.","JANAS 26(1) Plant : annual herb; 4-60 cm tall; Decumbent, ascending, or erect, simple or freely branched Leaves : narrowly to broadly elliptic, lanceolate, oblong, or ovate, (0.8-)2-9 cm long, 0.4-3 cm wide, longer than wide; apex attenuate to long attenuate or obtuse to rounded; base cuneate INFLORESCENCE : inglorescences of few flowered axillary cymes, the lowermost flowers usually perfect, those above pistillate Flowers : subtended by bracts ca. 1.8-5 mm long; tepals ca. 1.5-2 mm long, the bracts exceeding the tepals Fruit : achenes, symmetrical, 0.9-1.2 mm long, 0.6-0.9 mm broad, shining, hard and bony, ovoid, stipitate, enclosed by the perianth Misc : Dry ledges, talus slopes, waste and shaded places, preferring soils with a neutral or basic reaction; to 2200 m (7200 ft); spring-late fall REFERENCES : Boufford, David E. 1992.

Distribution : Apache, Coconino, Cochise, Santa Cruz, and Yavapai counties; western U.S., Canada, northern Mexico. Notes : Ours, as here described, is ssp. cerulea. Blue elderberry is tolerant of fire and has the ability to sprout from the root crown. It can be successfully propagated from seed and there is some evidence that it maintains a seed bank in the soil. Seed germination may require, or be improved by, scarification or stratification. The fruit is eaten by bears, small mammals, and birds, and the foliage provides good browse in the warmer months of the year for deer and elk. Ethnobotany : Elderberries are often eaten when cooked, as some species are poisonous in raw form. They are used in preserves, wine, or liquor (sambuca). Washes made from the bark have been used to soothe external sores. Berries make black or purple dye and the wood can be used to make musical instruments.

Notes : Chenopodium is a genus of usually weedy annual herbs with simple, alternate leaves, herbage that is commonly farinose (with mealy, or floury hairs) to some degree, and clusters of small green flowers lacking petals, which mature into fruits composed of a single seed wrapped in the persistent calyx. C. incanum is difficult to distinguish in the field from C. fremontii and C. neomexicana; very similar to C. album and C. berlandieri also; its absolutely necessary to have mature fruits to ID this group. Distinguished by being densely farinose throughout, much-branched from the base (C. fremontii branched above); triangular leaves with basal lobes; and smooth seeds that are not honeycombed. Also, the seeds are loose within the pericarp (in C. album and C. berlandieri the pericarp closely hugs the seeds.) Distinguished from C. fremontii by being more diffusely branched from the base, much more farinose throughout the entire plant, and having thicker leaves. Look for it in Chenopodiaceae in older texts; that entire family is now considered to be part of Amaranthaceae.

Stems first erect (greenish proximally), then producing herbaceous, leafy, prostrate runners (stoloniform branches, sometimes with rooting plantlets at tips), densely hirsutulous (hairs spreading-deflexed, of relatively even lengths and orientations), sparsely minutely glandular. Leaves mostly basal (persistent in early season); blades oblanceolate to spatulate (obovate-elliptic laminae), 10-30(-60) × 3-6(-12) mm, cauline abruptly reduced distally, margins entire, dentate, or lobed, faces densely hirsute, eglandular. Heads 1(-3 rarely, from midstem or proximal branches). Involucres 3.5-4.5(-6) × 6-9(-12) mm. Phyllaries in 3-4 series, sparsely to moderately hirsute, minutely glandular. Ray florets 60-130; corollas white, often purplish abaxially, sometimes with an abaxial midstripe, 5-9 mm, laminae not coiling or reflexing. Disc corollas 2-3 mm (throats indurate and slightly inflated). Cypselae 0.7-1.3 mm, 2-nerved, faces sparsely strigose; pappi: outer of setae, inner of 12-16 bristles. 2 n = 27. Flowering Mar-Oct.

In March through June, plants of Erigeron tracyi produce leaves in a basal rosette usually with a single, erect, monocephalous, stem. Stoloniform branches are soon formed (often recognized on pressed specimens by the leaves mostly on one side of the branches), and by the end of the season (August through October), prostrate runners are usually evident, sometimes forming terminal, rooting plantlets. Erigeron tracyi is similar in habit to E. flagellaris , particularly in the herbaceous stolons or stoloniform branches; the stem pubescence of E. tracyi is different, the stolons much less commonly produce rooting plantlets at the tips, and the plants tend to be perennial with woody or lignescent caudices, although they are variable both in habit and duration. Apparent hybrids with E. modestus and E. flagellaris are occasionally encountered, and the most common form of E. tracyi is perhaps (speculative) a stabilized, apomictic hybrid between the latter and E. divergens . All chromosome counts thus far have shown E. tracyi to be triploid and asynaptic.",,"Martin and Hutchins 1980, Heil et al 2013 Duration : Biennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Annual to short-lived perennial herbs, from a taproot and a simple or branched caudex;  stems branched near base, densely leafy on lower portions; upper stems leafless and terminating with a single flower head; later in season the plant produces long leafy stolons. Leaves : Basal and cauline; basal leaves are petioled, the blades broadly oblanceolate to spatulate, up to 7 cm long and 1 cm wide; cauline leaves are alternate, sessile, and smaller than the basal leaves, blades 1-2 cm long; leaf surfaces are densely cinereous-hirsute, the margins entire or occasionally toothed or lobed.

Fruits : Achenes 2-nerved and sparsely strigose; topped with a double pappus of bristles. Ecology : Found on dry slopes, from 5,500-8,000 ft (1676-2438 m); flowers April-July. Distribution : NV, UT, and AZ, east to KS, OK, and TX; south to MEX. Notes : Erigeron is a difficult genus, with many similar looking species distingushed from each other by subtle and obscure characters. A hand lens is necessary for field ID, and making a collection is generally advisable in order to have any confidence in a determination. Identify the genus as a whole from its characteristic daisy-like flowers with white to pale purple rays and yellow centers (although a few species have extremely small rays); involucres with 2-5 series of phyllaries, all about the same length (subequal); and tufts of bristles on the tops of the seeds. E. tracyi is quite similar to the common and widespread E. flagellaris; E. tracyi can be distinguished by the denser spreading hairs on its stems and flower stalks (E. flagellaris has appressed hairs); its slightly woody base; and the fact the stolons rarely root at the tips. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genus have uses.

Gamochaeta purpurea apparently is native to North America and adventive elsewhere. Basal cells of hairs on adaxial faces of leaves are expanded and glassy (versus hairs filiform to bases in most other species) and are diagnostic for Gamochaeta purpurea . From Maryland northward, plants of G. purpurea produce relatively small basal rosettes and relatively shallow fibrous roots or a filiform taproot; southward and southwestward, the basal rosettes often are larger and the fibrous roots are denser. Gamochaeta purpurea apparently occurs widely through the world as a weed; it is fairly clearly native to eastern North America, where it is the least weedy of the gamochaetas. Plants of G. purpurea in southern Arizona along perennial streams at the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains were first collected in 1903 (G. L. Nesom 2004) and were, perhaps, accidentally established through visitation; the same sites are heavily infested by other, more aggressive, nonnative species. Collections of G. purpurea also have been made at higher elevations in the Santa Catalina, Rincon, and Chiricahua mountains, where the species is less likely to have been introduced by human activity.

Flowers : Flower heads discoid, with arachnoid hairs at the bases, arranged in spikes 1-10 cm long; involucre (ring of bracts wrapped around the flower head) top-shaped to cylindric, 4 mm high, the outer phyllaries (bracts) brownish or purplish, at least the tips, obtuse, shining; inner phyllaries thinner and paler than outer, often acutish or minutely toothed and apiculate at apex; florets all discs, numerous, 1.5-2 mm long, very slender, the corollas usually with purplish tips. Fruits : Achenes straw-colored, about 0.5 mm long, faintly roughened; topped with a pappus of 7-15 bristles which are connate at the base into in a funnel-shaped ring and falling together.

Amer. from Ontario, CAN to ME, south to FL and TX; disjunct in AZ. Notes : This biennial to perennial herb closely resembles Gnaphalium and Pseudognaphalium spp.; Gamochaeta is segregated from those two genera based on its achenes which have a pappus of bristles which are fused into a ring at the base (although Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum also has such a pappus.) The closest relative of this species is Gamochaeta stagnalis, which differs in its its height and growth form, tending to be shorter, less rigidly erect, and with more stems emerging at the base of the plant; the leaves which are about the same color on the upper and lower surfaces (G. purpurea is distinctly more grayish on the lower leaf surfaces and green on the upper leaf); and the inner (and taller) rows of phyllaries which are bluntly rounded on the tip and tend to be more strongly infused with purple (use a hand lens; G. purpurea has pointy-tipped phyllaries which are less often purple-infused). G. purpurea is a somewhat more robust plant, considered to be a biennial to short lived perennial, while G. stagnalis is commonly annual but can persist into a second year. Distinguish from P. luteoalbum by the leaves, which are distinctly green on top and gray beneath in this species, and only slightly more white-tomentose on the lower surface in P. luteoalbum. Ethnobotany : Infusion of dried plant taken for the grippe and colds. Synonyms : Gnaphalium purpureum Editor : SBuckley 2010, AHazelton 2016 Etymology : Gamochaeta comes from the Greek gamos, ""marriage, stigma, female part,"" and chaite, ""bristle, mane, long hair,"" thus meaning ""united bristle"" in reference to the connate pappus bristles; purpurea means purple.",Gamochaeta purpurea,ASTERACEAE,perennial,non-native,0,herb,5.0,2286.0

Can be common or dominant in Chihuahuan desert scrub and grasslands, and on limestone in other deserts. It is closely related to guayule (Parthenium argentatum) a northern Mexican species cultivated for its natural rubber content. P. incanum is said to contain a small amount of rubber as well and can hybridize with P. argentatum where their ranges overlap. Ethnobotany : The leaves were boiled and drunk like coffee; also used medicinally by the Jicarilla Apache. Etymology : Parthenium is from the Greek parthenos, virginal or pure, alluding to the white flowers; incanum means grayish or hoary.

Distribution : s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, NM, s TX; south to n MEX. Notes : Positive field identification of Phacelia is quite difficult as species delimitations usually rely on seed morphology. This species is most similar to P. crenulata but distinguished by the petiolate stem leaves with rounded lobes that divide the leaf not more than halfway to the midrib, and stamens included within or only slightly exserted from the corolla (P. crenulata has lower leaves lobed almost to the midrib, upper leaves that are sessile, and stamens exserted 3-10 mm out of the corolla). Look also for the scorpiod inflorescence; the bell-shaped lavender flowers; calyx lobes broad and pointed and little or not surpassing the fruit; seeds corrugated with ridges on the margins of the excavated side; and stems that are brittle and break easily when picked up. Usually found in rocky sites with flowers that are generally much smaller than other Phacelia spp. This species has been published as P. caerulea and as P. coerulea; Tropicos and ITIS recognize the P. coerulea spelling but the Flora Neomexicana (Allred and Ivey 2012) uses P. caerulea. The genus Phacelia has at different times been placed in Hyrophyllaceae (the water-leaf family) and Boraginaceae (the borage family), so you may need to check both families before finding it in reference books and herbarium cabinets. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genus are boiled and eaten as greens. Etymology : Phacelia is based on the Greek phakelos, meaning ""cluster,"" alluding to the densely crowded flower spikes of most species of the genus; coerulea means blue, referring to the flower color.

Leaves : Basal leaves short-petiolate; stem leaves alternate and sessile or short-petiolate; blades 2-9 cm long, 2-3 times pinnate, the ultimate divisions linear. Flowers : Yellow, in terminal racemes on pedicels 8-15 mm long which are ascending in flower and spreading to ascending when in fruit; sepals 4, erect to ascending, yellowish, 2-3 mm long; petals 2-3 mm long, yellow. Fruits : Capsules linear, 1-3 cm long, often curved, slightly constricted between the seeds, loosely ascending to erect; seeds numerous, 1 mm long, reddish brown, in one row per locule. Ecology : Found on open and disturbed ground from 3,000-7,500 ft (915-2285m); flowers April-June. Distribution : Native to North Africa and Eurasia; Introduced to South Africa, Australia, S. Amer., N. Amer. In every US state except FL. Notes : Descurainia is a genus of weedy-looking mustards with feathery, pinnately lobed leaves, racemes of inconspicuous white to yellow flowers, and narrow seed pods. The raceme is compact when in flower and then expands substantially in fruit so that the seed pods are well-spaced along the stalk. To distinguish among the various species of Descurainia, focus on the shape, size, and orientation of the seed pods. D. obtusa has straight, narrow (1 mm wide), linear seed pods 1-2 cm long which are slightly constricted between the seeds and can be horizontal or upward pointing. D. pinnata has seed pods which are a bit wider and rounded at the tip compared to the base (clavate, or club-shaped), about 1 cm long, not constricted between the seeds, and the pods point upwards even though the pedicels tend to be more horizontal or only slightly upward pointing. D. sophia is more similar to D. obtusa; like D. obtua it has ascending-spreading pods which are narrow and slightly constricted between the seeds; however the pods are glabrous, tend to be slightly longer (1.5- 3 cm long), and the pods themselves tend to curve a bit upward at maturity (D. obtusa has almost completely straight pods). D. sophia is an exotic species, often found in dry and disturbed areas. It produces exceptionally large seed crops, which can lead to its dominance at sites as well as helping it re-establish rapidly after a fire. Host plant for Checkered White and Beckers White butterflies. Ethnobotany : Edible greens and seeds. Tansy mustard appears in clan names and migration tales as an important plant. Etymology : Descurainia is named for French pharmacist and botanist Franscois Descourain (1658-1740); sophia translates to wisdom.

Subspecies sativa , widely naturalized and cultivated, was first introduced as a weed in North America in Flathead County, Montana, in 1898, with additional reports from 1900 to the 1920s as a seed contaminant of alfalfa fields in the United States. Subspecies vesicaria and pinnatifida (Desfontaines) Emberger & Maire are endemic to Spain and North Africa and have escaped from cultivation in Europe; they seem not to have become adventive in North America (R. C. Rollins 1993). Recent molecular studies by S. I. Warwick and L. D. Black (1993) support the treatment of subsp. vesicaria and its presumed derivative subsp. sativa as a single species; subsp. pinnatifida is maintained as Eruca pinnatifida (Desfontaines) Pomel. The earliest cultivation of subsp . sativa dates back to the ancient Romans and Greeks. It is currently grown in Europe and North America as a salad plant and in Asia for cooking oil and as food for animals. The oil is also used as an industrial lubricant and for cosmetic and medicinal purposes (I. A. Al-Shehbaz 1985). The seed cake and the entire plant are used as fodder for domestic animals.

Hitchcock distinguished var. insulare from var. oblongum on the basis of having fruits smaller (2-2.5 versus 2.5-3 mm) and rotund to obovate (versus elliptic or obovate-elliptic) and fruiting pedicels puberulent (versus glabrous) abaxially. The shape and size of fruits almost never covary, and some of the insular plants (e.g., Trask 28 , GH) have the largest fruits; some populations from Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas have smaller and perfectly orbicular fruits. As for the pubescence of fruiting pedicels, some of the inland plants cited by Hitchcock as L. oblongum (e.g., Brewer 27 , GH) have pedicels pubescent abaxially. A recent report of Lepidium bonariense naturalized in Skagit County, Washington, was based on misidentified L. oblongum ; all the vouchers for it belong to the latter species. Lepidium oblongum often has several stems from base, usually auriculate distalmost leaves, and fruits 2-3 mm wide.

Spines (0-)3-11 per areole, straight to curved or contorted, appressed (radial spines) or spreading to projecting outward (some radials and central spines when present), white to yellow, gray, or black; radial spines (0-)1-10 per areole, (0-)15-90 mm; central spines 0-1(-4) per areole, angular, (0-)50-120 mm. Flowers (4-)5-10 × 3-7 cm; flower tube 20-35 mm; flower tube hairs 1-2 mm; inner tepals bright orange-red to dark red, proximally paler (bases sometimes yellow or white), (18-)25-40 × (5-)10-15 mm, tips thick and rigid; anthers usually pink to purple; nectar chamber 5-11 mm. Fruits green to yellow-green or pink (rarely red), (15-)20-35 mm, pulp white. 2 n = 22. Flowering Apr-Jun; fruiting 2-2.5 months after flowering. Upper edge of Mojave Desert to coniferous forests, igneous and calcareous rock outcrops, cliffs, and sandy hills; 1000-2800 m; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Nev., N.Mex., Utah. Echinocereus triglochidiatus is the earliest name for a large group of diploid and polyploid taxa treated as conspecific by L. D. Benson (1969, 1982). The tetraploids are now recognized separately as E. coccineus, including E. polyacanthus Engelmann of Mexico. The diploids in the flora area are here divided into two allopatric species: E. triglochidiatus and E. arizonicus. Plants in the western portion of the range of Echinocereus triglochidiatus have been called E. triglochidiatus var. mojavensis (Engelmann & J. M. Bigelow) L. D. Benson. That taxon includes curly-spined plants (mainly in California) and straight-spined plants (including most populations in Arizona, Utah, and western Colorado). The latter were mapped by L. D. Benson (1969, 1982) as part of his concept of E. triglochidiatus var. melanacanthus. Plants with the fewest and largest spines, called E. triglochidiatus var. triglochidiatus, occupy the eastern portion of the species´ distribution. The largest spines, whether central or radial, of var. triglochidiatus are sharply angular in cross section and 1-2 mm thick. Less distinctive plants have been called Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. gonacanthus , a name carelessly applied to miscellaneous plants throughout the range of var. triglochidiatus . A well-known population at White Sands, New Mexico, inhabits saline flats adjacent to pure gypsum dunes. The unusually large, southernmost plants at White Sands, New Mexico, shrink to the same size as northern plants when grown together in a common garden (D. Weniger 1970). The epithet inermis has been applied at various taxonomic ranks to individual plants with spines absent or nearly so in the eastern portion of var. mojavensis (in and around southeastern Utah). A geographically distant tetraploid, Echinocereus coccineus var. paucispinus, superficially resembles some eastern E. triglochidiatus but may be distinguished by its relatively terete and more consistently straight spines. Small plants of var. triglochidiatus without reproductive structures might be confused with E. fendleri ; records of E. triglochidatus from near the Mexican border probably are misidentifications of E. fendleri in vegetative condition.",,"FNA 2003, Benson 1982, USDA Plants Common Name : kingcup cactus Duration : Perennial Protected Status : No status in Arizona. General : Unbranched or 1-12 branched mounds of branches that are often dense and rarely to 300 stems, the stems usually erect or nearly so and cylindric to spheric, 5-70 cm long and 5-13 cm diameter with 5-12 ribs that have slightly undulate crests bearing areoles 10-40 mm apart. Spines : Spines 3-11 per areole that are straight to curved or contorted with radial spines appressed or spreading to projecting outward, these white to yellow, gray, or black, the radial spines 1-10 per areole and 15-90 mm, while the central spines are only 0-1 per areole and angular while 50-120 mm long. Flowers : Whole flower 5-10 cm long with the flower tube 20-35 mm, the inner tepals bright orange red to dark red but paler below, these 25-40 mm long and 10-15 mm diameter with tips thick and rigid, the anthers usually pink to purple and areoles with spines and white hairs. Fruits : Green to yellow green, pink or red, 20-35 mm, with a deciduous mass of spines. Ecology : Found on igneous to calcareous rock outcrops, along cliffs and on sandy slopes from 3,500-9,000 ft (1067- 2743 m), flowers April-June. Notes : This is the earliest name for a complex of diploid and polyploid taxa according to FNA. Since the 1980s, these taxa have been separated into tetraploid and polyploid divisions. There are still a few varieties, but all of those are not totally accepted by USDA Plants DB or ITIS, so this is still a complex in process. Ethnobotany : Water was extracted in emergencies, the pulp was made into cakes and candy, the fruit was eaten fresh, as jam, the pulp was baked and eaten like squash,and the dried pulp was used for candles. Etymology : Echinocereus is from the Greek echinos, hedgehog or spine and cereus, waxy, while triglochidiatus means with three glochids.

Inflorescences  numerous.  Flowers  unisexual, often transitional flowers and flowers of opposite sex developing later.  Staminate flowers:  pedicels 0.5-3 mm; sepals ovate to lanceolate, 2.5-4 mm, puberulent; stamens caducous after anthesis, somewhat shorter than sepals; filaments 0.5-1 mm.  Pistillate flowers  ± sessile, enclosed by glandular, beaked bracteole and subtended by bract; perianth appressed to and surrounding base of ovary.

Flowering early summer-fall; staminate plants generally dying after anthesis, pistillate plants remaining dark green, persisting until frost.

Cannabis sativa has been reported as cultivated illegally and as apparently ruderal in all provinces and states except Alaska. It has been collected least frequently in Mississippi and Idaho. It seems to be best established in the prairies and plains of central North America. Hemp is a short-day plant; flowering depends upon the latitude of origin. Races originating closer to the equator (and generally higher in psychointoxicant) require a longer induction period for flowering than races originating farther north. The taxonomy of Cannabis sativa , a polymorphic species, has been debated in scientific and legal forums. The name C . sativa subsp. indica (Lamarck) E. Small & Cronquist has been applied to plants with a mean leaf content of the psychotomimetic (hallucinatory) delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol of at least 0.3%; those with a lesser content fall under C . sativa subsp. sativa . When separate species are recognized, the name C . indica Lamarck has generally been applied to variants with high levels of the intoxicant chemical, whereas the name C . sativa Linnaeus, interpreted in a restricted sense, has generally been applied to plants selected for their yield of bast fibers in the stems. (The latter generally have taller, hollow stems with longer internodes and less branching than races selected for drug content.) Superimposed on this dimension of variation is selection for nonabscising achenes in cultivation and abscising achenes in the wild (i.e., outside of cultivation). This is analagous to selection of nonshattering cereals from wild, shattering grasses. Achenes selected for cultivation tend to be longer than 3.8 mm and lack a basal constricted zone; by contrast, achenes selected for wild existence tend to be shorter than 3.8 mm and to have a basal constricted zone that seems to facilitate disarticulation and a mottled, persistent perianth apparently serving as camouflage. Within Cannabis sativa subsp. sativa , the wild phase has been named C . sativa var. spontanea Vavilov (= C . ruderalis Janishevsky), in contrast to the domesticated C . sativa var. sativa . Within C . sativa subsp. indica , the wild phase (not to be expected in North America) has been designated C . sativa var. kafiristanica (Vavilov) E. Small & Cronquist, as distinct from the domesticated C . sativa var. indica . The chemical and morphologic distinctions by which Cannabis has been split into taxa are often not readily discernible, appear to be environmentally modifiable, and vary in a continuous fashion. For most purposes it will suffice to apply the name Cannabis sativa to all plants encountered in North America. * The Iroquois used Cannabis sativa medicinally to convince patients that they had recovered.

Cyperus rotundus is documented in Connecticut, Delaware, New York, and Pennsylvania; there is no evidence of persistent populations. Cyperus esculentus and C. rotundus are the only two species of subg. Cyperus in the New World that produce tuberiferous stolons.  The two species also have persistent floral scales and persistent rachillas, a combination of characteristics not found in any other New World species of Cyperus. Cyperus rotundus is distinguished from other species of the genus in the New World by its open spikes composed of linear reddish spikelets borne on a conspicuous slender rachis.  Cyperus rotundus is usually acknowledged to be the world´s worst weed (cf. G. C. Tucker 1987).  In the United States, it does not grow north of the mean 1°C January isotherm.  Cyperus esculentus (preceding species) is a serious weed in much of the world, especially in cooler regions where the more tropical C. rotundus does not grow.  Cyperus esculentus is able to tolerate lower air temperatures (as low as -18°C).  The two species apparently differ also in their thermal optima for growth.",,"Tucker 1994, FNA 2002, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Common Name : nutgrass Duration : Perennial Nativity : Non-Native Lifeform : Graminoid General : Perennial with wiry indurate stolons, springy when dried, 5-12 cm long, 1-2 mm in diameter, bearing tubers 3-8 mm in diameter, stems 10-35 cm tall, 0.5-3.5 mm in diameter, three sided, smooth, hardened basally.

In E. davidii, the cyathia (modified flowers) are clustered into cyme-like inflorescences at branch tips. Involucres are glabrous, bell-shaped, and 2-3 mm high, with 1 (sometimes 2) cup-shaped gland and no petaloid appendages; 10-20 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsule 4 mm wide, distinctly 3-lobed, depressed-spheric, glabrous or sparsely hairy, splitting into 3 single seeded sections at maturity; seeds 3 mm long, ovoid, 3-angled, coarsely tubercled. Ecology : Found in waste places and dry, disturbed sites, below 5,000 ft (1524 m) Distribution : USDA Plants lists this species as introduced to the US, but USDA GRIN lists it as native to North America, with its native range consisting of KS, NE, OK, TX, WY, CO, NM, AZ, and northern Mexico.  It is listed as naturalized in Eurasia, Australia, and the Notes : E. davidii is often reported as, and was originally placed within E. dentata. These two species are distinguished from other Euphorbia in our area by the combination of being erect annuals with opposite branching; unlobed, dentate leaves 4-8 cm long that are mostly clustered near the top of the plant; and the single cupped gland of the cyathia without any petaloid appendages. Differentiated from E. dentata by the strongly tapered hairs on the undersides of leaves; petioles almost as long as the leaves (vs. 1/3 as long in E. dentata); cyathia with gland-tipped fringes; and angular seeds (seeds are rounded in E. dentata).  E. exstipulata is similar  but is a smaller plant, under 25 cm tall, and has 4 glands per involucre, and 4 white petaloid appendages. E. davidii, E. dentata, and E. exstipulata are all members of the Pointsettia section of Euphorbia. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genus had medicinal uses. Etymology : Euphorbia is named for Euphorbus, Greek physician of Juba II, King of Mauretania, while davidii is named for David Lee Anderson 1938- , range management ecologist who spent years in Argentina.

Leaves : Opposite along the stems and branches, with most leaves clustered near branch tips with the flowers; blade linear to lanceolate, 2-4 cm long and 3-30 mm wide, finely serrate, the tip pointed, and the base symmetric and tapered into a short petiole; with tiny glandlike stipules at the base of the petioles. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In Euphorbia exstipulata, the cyathia (modified flowers) are clustered into leafy cyme-like inflorescences at branch tips. Involucres are top-shaped or bell-shaped, and 1.5 mm high, and glabrous or hairy, with 4 pink to yellow glands around the edge, each with a tiny white to pink petaloid appendage which is sometimes divided into triangular lobes; 10-12 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsule distinctly 3-lobed, depressed-oblong to ovoid, 3 mm wide, sparsely hairy; seeds white to gray or light brown, ovoid, 2 mm long, bluntly 4-angled in cross section, tuberculate (bumpy), often with 2 transverse ridges. Ecology : Found in dry rocky spots from 3,000-6,500 ft (914-1981 m); flowers August-October. Distribution : s CA, s UT, AZ, NM, s TX; south to c MEX. Notes : Distinguished by being a low, erect annual with opposite branching on the lower stems and often forked branching in the inflorescence; narrow opposite leaves, most of them with serrate edges; leaves below the flowers all green (in other species these can be bicolored); flowers have toothed white petaloid appendages; and angled seeds. Broad-leaved plants are sometimes segregated as var. lata (not to be confused with Euphorbia lata, a synonym of Chamaesyce lata and a completely different species), but the variation in leaf shape is continuous and FNA and Allred do not formally recognize any varieties. E. davidii is similar but is generally a larger plant, has only one gland per involucre, and lacks petaloid appendages. This species is a member of the Pointsettia section of Euphorbia. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genus have uses. Etymology : Euphorbia is named for Euphorbus, Greek physician of Juba II, King of Mauretania; exstipulata means lacking stipules, alluding to the tiny reduced gland-like stipules.

Flowers : Red-purple and bilaterally symmetrical, solitary in the axils of most leaves; each flower on a stalk 1-3 cm long; sepals 5, spreading, hairy on the outer surface, deep purple and showy, resembling petals; lowermost sepal 10-16 mm long and 3-6 mm wide, the other sepals slightly smaller; 2 lower petals modified into oil-secreting glands (called elaiophores), 1.5-3 mm long, pink, apricot-colored or reddish; upper 3 petals clawed and united near the base, cream or pink, about half the length of the sepals. Fruits : Capsules globose, 5-6 mm wide, covered with stout yellow spines, 2-5 mm long; containing 1 seed. Ecology : Found in open areas, often in grassy sites with oak, or oak and pine from 4,000-5,500 ft (1219-1676 m); flowers May-August. Distribution : s AZ, s CO, NM, s KS, OK, TX, AR, GA, FL; south to s MEX. Notes : Distinct from the other two Krameria spp in its being the only perennial herb, wheras the others are shrubs. The sprawling, laying-down habit, gray-green hairy leaves, and spine-covered fruits are distinctive, as are the irregular reddish-purple flowers with 5 showy, hairy sepals, and 3 smaller petals that are fused together for the lower half. Look for this genus in the pea family(Fabaceae) in older texts; it has since been classified in its own family, Krameriaceae. Ethnobotany : Unknown Etymology : Krameria named after Johann Georg Heinrich Kramer (1684-1744) an Austrian physician and botanist; lanceolata refers to the shape of the leaves.

Leaves : Opposite, on slender petioles 4-10 mm long, with leaf pairs emerging from the stem at right angles relative to the pair of leaves below it (decussate); blades ovate, 2-4 cm long and 6-18 mm wide, irregularly and coarsely dentate, bright green and finely puberulent. Flowers : White to pink, in clusters of about 3 flowers at branch tips and in axils of upper leaves; each flower on a slender peduncle 3-8 mm long; calyx bell-shaped (campanulate), hairy, deeply divided into 5 unequal lobes; corolla twice as long as calyx, salverform, with a narrow tube topped with 5 abruptly spreading, rounded lobes; corolla tube and lobes white to cream colored, with the outside often tinged with red or pink. Fruits : Nutlets pyrimid-shaped, strongly and coarsely reticulated, finely pubescent. Ecology : Found in sandy soils and rocky slopes below 5,500 ft (1676 m); flowers April-August. Distribution : AZ, NM, sw TX; south to s MEX. Notes : Until recently this species was called Tetraclea coulteri, in the Verbena family (Verbenaceae). Now it has been re-classified into the closely related mint family (Lamiaceae) and renamed Clerodendrum coulteri. However, the change is so recent that none of the texts have adapted it. Look for relatively small, erect perennials, often with many stems from the same base; foliage that slightly gray-tinted due to the rough pubescence all over; opposite leaves and obscurely square-angled stems; clusters of attractive, 5-petaled white to pink flowers in the leaf axils; and a fruit of 4 furry nutlets. There are 2 varieties: Var. coulteri is as described above, with ovate leaves that are only slightly toothed. Var. angustifolia has smaller, narrowly oblong leaves, which are more obviously toothed than the typical variety. It also tends to have longer, more slender stems. The two varieties are said to intergrade. Ethnobotany : Used as a ceremonial medicine and as a fever medicine. Etymology : Tetraclea comes from the Greek tetra, four, and kleio, enclosed, alluding to the four nutlets surrounded by the calyx; coulteri is named for Dr. Thomas Coulter (1793-1843) an Irish botanist.

Some authors consider Mollugo verticillata a native of the New World tropics that spread northward into subtropical and temperate regions (M. L. Fernald 1950; H. A. Gleason and A. Cronquist 1991). If so, the species apparently spread very rapidly, because herbarium specimens exist from Ohio in 1828, Michigan in 1837, and Maine in 1837. J. Chapman et al. (1974) presented archaeological evidence of pre-Columbian presence of M. verticillata at a site in Tennessee. Morphology and anatomy of the species are well studied. T. Holm (1911) investigated anisophyly in Mollugo verticillata and stated that the leaves are not 'pseudo-verticillate,' as described by some earlier authors, but are truly opposite. M. A. Payne (1933, 1935) conducted morphologic and anatomic analyses of the leaf, stem, root, flower, and seed of the species. Pollen morphology was examined by N. Mitroiu (1971). Several subspecific taxa have been described for Mollugo verticillata , but these are poorly understood; attempts to subdivide the species in North America for this treatment failed. The species is extremely morphologically variable, especially with regard to leaf shape, overall size, and habit. There seem to be no direct correlations between habitat type and morphology. Mollugo verticillata possesses intermediate C3-C4 photosynthetic pathway characteristics, such as well- defined bundle-sheaths with numerous C4-like chloroplasts, distinct palisade and spongy parenchyma as in C3 plants, and intermediate light to dark ratios of CO2 evolution, which have made the species of particular interest in studies of the evolution and biochemistry of both photosynthetic pathways (R. A. Kennedy et al. 1980).","JANAS 30(2) Plant : annual herb; glabrous, sometimes glaucous, stems mostly prostrate or ascending, to 28 (-40) cm long Leaves : of basal rosette to 40 mm long, to 10 (-16) mm wide, oblanceolate to obovate; cauline leaves to 20 (-36) mm long, 1-5 (-7) mm wide, oblanceolate Flowers : 1-several, pedicellate, sepals 5, 1.5-3 mm long, mostly 3-nerved; stamens usually 3, nearly equalling the sepals, pistils mostly 3-carpellate, the styles short or stigmas subsessile Fruit : FRUITS capsules, exceeding the sepals by 1/4-1/2 of their length, the apex 3-lobed.

The phase Boerhavia gracillima subsp. decalvata from low elevations in the Big Bend region of Texas and adjacent Mexico differs from the remainder of B. gracillima in that it is usually erect or strongly ascending, has glabrous fruits, and has flowers with purple to brick red perianths; the flowers are also in the upper half of the size range for the species. It is highly local and completely intergradient with surrounding populations of B. gracillima in the strict sense. In fruit and flower features the phase resembles B. anisophylla ; in its diffuse inflorescence with slender branches (0.15 mm diam. proximal to the flower versus 0.25 mm in B. anisophylla ) and in its deciduous bracts it is more similar to B. gracillima . Some populations of B. gracillima also have glabrous fruits, and a local endemic in Durango, B. chrysantha Barneby, differs primarily in its yellow perianths similar in size to those of B. gracillima subsp. decalvata .

Notes : Flowering spikes much smaller than B. barbinodis, the florets also much smaller with glabrous nodes. Florets also lack the cottony nature of B. barbinodis, nor are stems as large. Could be confused at a glance with Chloris virgata with the fan-shaped feathery panicle, pay attention to its caespitose perennial habit and the reddish tint of inflorescences.Introduced in our region for erosion control and for forage, now colonized many areas along roads.

Notes : Distinguished by its erect to laying-down (decumbent) growth form; spreading and wiry stems rhizomes, and often long stolons, which are woolly. A quite useful diagnostic character when the plant is matured and dry are the dark colored internodes covered by silvery-pubescence, alternating along the stem with the straw-colored, non-hairy leaf sheaths; when fresh, the internodes are green and covered with silvery pubescence, and the leaf sheaths are green and non-hairy. Also helpful are the 14-50 mm long inflorescence branches which have tufts of hair at the bases and are relatively slender when compared with other perennial Boutelouas. Each spikelet has 3 awns emerging from it, making them reminiscent of an Aristida.

fields, sand dunes, and limestone areas. It occurs from southwestern British
Columbia to Baja California, Mexico, and eastward to Montana, Colorado, Texas,
and scattered locations in the eastern United States. The common name -ripgut
grass- suggests possible damage to animals if they consume the sharp,
long-awned florets of this species. Bromus diandrus , as treated here, includes B. rigidus Roth. Sales (1993) reduced these
two taxa to varietal rank, and pointed out that the differences between them

America, and S. America; found in every state in the US. Notes : Until very recently this taxon was placed within the genus Leptochloa. Look for it under that name even in relatively recent texts. It is a robust annual grass with noticably compressed stems where they emerge from the ground, and panicles of long spikelike branches that are often partly sheathed even at maturity. In our region there are two subspecies: ssp. uninervia and ssp. fascicularis. The former is told apart by the slightly longer anthers; the 5-10 mm spikelets; and the dark green to lead-gray lemmas which are obtuse to truncate at the tip. Subsp. fascicularis is distinguished by the panicles being partially enclosed in the upper sheath; the upper leaves which are taller than the panicle; and the mature lemmas are often smoky white with a dark spot in the basal half, with tapering tip. Another annual, Leptochloa viscida, is also found in the Sororan Desert; it has consistently short-awned lemmas (vs. frequently unawned or mucronate lemmas in L. fusca), smaller panicles, an often prostrate and much-branched growth habit, and often reddish florets (vs. L. fusca's whitish or gray florets). A halophyte, L. fusca has potential for use in bioremediation of saline soils. Ethnobotany : Used as fodder for livestock around the world. Etymology : Leptochloa is from Greek leptos, slender and chloe or chloa, grass, while fusca means dark or brown.

 570-3400 m. Its range extends from the southwestern United States to northern 
 Mexico, and, as a disjunct, in Argentina and Bolivia. It was found as an adventive 
 (associated with wool waste) in North Berwick, York County, Maine, in 1902, 
 but it has not been reported from there since. Its flowering time is July-October. Lycurus setosus is sometimes confused with Muhlenbergia 
 wrightii , which has a somewhat similar aspect but is normally found 
 in moist habitats. Also, in M. wrightii the first glume is 1-veined with 
 a very short awn, and the lemma is acuminate and unawned or with an awn no more 
 than 1 mm long.
Peterson and Columbus state that this species should be transferred to Muhlenbergia as M. alopecuroides but do not explicitly address the position of the other two species of Lycurus.

Notes : Distinguished by being an erect perennial bunchgrass to 50 cm tall, with leaves that are tipped with a small awn or bristle; and bristly spike-like inflorescences of single-flowered awned spikelets. Can be confused with Muhlenbergia wrightii which is similar, but that species grows at higher elevatations; has a first glume which is 1-veined and tipped with a very short awn; and has a lemma that is acuminate and unawned, or with a short awn no more than 1 mm long. Peterson and Columbus (2010) include this species in an expanded Muhlenbergia (as Muhlenbergia alopecuroides) to make that genus monophyletic . Some other sources, including the 2012 Flora Neomexicana, continue to use the name Lycurus setosus. The basic character to distinguish this species is bristles on the tips of the upper leaves. Felger et al. 2011 put all the former Lycurus into this species.

Notes : Sporobolus species have single-seeded spikelets with unequal glumes, no awns, and most often small seeds which readily fall after maturing hence the common name ""dropseed."" One of the largest grasses in the region, this species often forms clumps of fountain-like grass more than 1 m in diameter and can grow to 2 m tall. It has an open panicle and pedicels and spikelets which are appressed to branches of the inflorescence. S. wrightii is an interesting species ecologically, as a shrub-sized grass that can be dominant on a landscape. It is restricted to floodplains due to its need to access groundwater for survival. It was much more abundant and common historically, covering valley bottoms that have since been overgrazed, plowed up for agriculture, dewatered by groundwater pumping, or transitioned to cottonwood-willow gallery forest after massive floods circa 1900 initiated arroyo cutting throughout the southwest.

Canadian populations of Anagallis arvensis are primarily found in southern coastal regions and the lower Great Lakes. The species has been reported also from Alberta, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saskatchewan, and Minnesota; it is not established in those areas. The flowers close on cloudy days and as evening approaches, hence the name weatherglass. P. E. Gibbs and S. Talavera (2001) found that Anagallis arvensis self-pollinates as the petals close. This is the most variable species of Anagallis , with reddish flowers once thought to be common in more northerly latitudes and blue flowers in southern areas. There are numerous intermediate color forms. The blue form has been the source of confusion in the nomenclature of this taxon. Linnaeus described the blue form of A. arvensis as A. caerulea . Schreber used A. coerulea (note the spelling) as did Lamarck for a related taxon that is now included within A. foemina Miller. Subsequent authors submerged A. caerulea/coerulea into A. arvensis as a forma, variety, or subspecies, incorrectly crediting either Schreber or Lamarck. L. F. Ferguson (1972) distinguished A. foemina Miller (including Schreber´s A. coerulea ), which consistently produces blue flowers, as a separate entity differing, in part, by petals having few to no marginal hairs, which, when present, have elongate terminal cells (in A. arvensis the petal margins have numerous gland-tipped, globose hairs), and by having flowering pedicels equaling or shorter than the subtending leaf.","JANAS 26(1) Plant : Annual herb; 5-45 cm long, with prostrate stems Leaves : cauline, opposite, 0.5-2 cm long, sessile; blade ovate, glabrous Flowers : orange or salmon-colored to scarlet; calyx deeply lobed, 2-7 mm long; corolla deeply lobed, 2-7 mm long, the lobes with stalked glands on the outer margins, stamens 5; ovary superior Fruit : circumscissile capsules Misc : Moist meadows, stream banks, pond edges and moist disturbed areas; 300-1650 m (1000-5400 ft); Mar-Jun REFERENCES : Cholewa Anita F. 1992.

Like its close relative Cheilanthes lindheimeri , C . wootonii is an apogamous triploid of unknown parentage. With the recognition of C . yavapensis as a distinct species, the name C . wootonii is restricted to populations with leaf blades that appear glabrous adaxially, costal scales that are often ciliate only in the proximal half, and stem scales that are usually brown and loosely appressed. In addition, C. wootonii is distinguished from C. yavapensis by having smaller spores, averaging less than 62 µm in diameter. These characteristics can be subtle, and some specimens will be difficult to place in either C . wootonii or C . yavapensis . T.

Distribution : se CA, s NV, and s UT, east through AZ and NM to se CO, w OK, and w TX; south to n MEX. Notes : Look for this plant under the name Cheilanthes wootonii, in texts and in the herbarium. Molecular evidence shows that species traditionally placed in the genus Cheilanthes are not all from a single evolutionary lineage, so botanists are in the process of splitting up the genus. The result is that most North American Cheilanthes are very recently placed in the genus Myriopteris. This species can be distinguished by the tiny bead-like leaflets appearing glabrous and green on the upper surface, and being covered with light brown scales on the lower surface; also the frond stalks are covered with brown scales which look a bit like hairs to the naked eye; use your hand lens to see the scales! When you dig it up, you'll see the fronds are often spaced out along the rhizome, not densely clustered and emerging from the same point. Ethnobotany : A cold infusion of the plant was applied to gunshot wounds; also used ceremonially as a Life Medicine. Etymology : Myriopteris is from the Greek words myrios, or myriad, and pteris, fern, because the frond is divided into so many leaflets; wootonii is named for American botanist Elmer Otis Wooton (1865-1945), former curator of the National Herbarium.

Va., Wis., Wyo.; Eurasia. Prior to N. Hotchkiss and H. L. Dozier (1949), Typha domingensis was generally included within T. angustifolia in North America. Because of many misidentified specimens, range expansion in recent years, and undercollecting, the distribution on the margins of the main range is somewhat uncertain. Many literature reports are based on misidentified specimens. Some workers suggested T. angustifolia was early introduced from Europe into Atlantic Coastal North America and migrated westward (R. L. Stuckey and D. P. Salamon 1987). In recent decades it has expanded its range in many regions and become much more abundant, especially in roadside ditches and other highly disturbed habitats. For example, although it was known only from one Wisconsin station in 1929 (N. C. Fassett 1930) and was very local in Iowa in 1939 (A. Hayden 1939), it is now common and widespread in both states. As it often out-competes many native marsh species to produce very dense, pure stands, and hybridizes with T. latifolia to form the probably even more competitive T. glauca, T. angustifolia and T. glauca should perhaps be classified as noxious weeds in parts of North America. Beyond the main range of T. angustifolia, there are specimens of T. glauca from north-central Montana (Phillips County.), west-central Manitoba (La Pas), and Anticosti Island, Quebec. There are m Many erroneous reports have come from outside of Europe and North America. For hybrids see also genus and key.",,,Typha angustifolia,TYPHACEAE,perennial,non-native,0,grass,0.0,1900.0

The style persists as a cap or beak on the top of the fruit until the fruit splits into nutlets. Sister genus Tribulus appears quite similar in growth form, but the fruits split into 5 spiny nutlets at maturity. Despite its specific epithet translating to ""small flower,"" K. parviflora has larger flowers (petals 6-12 mm) than similar species K. hirsutissima and K. californica (both with petals 5 mm or less). K. parviflora is also distinguished by having orange-yellow flowers, and the beak of the fruit is longer than the nutlets, while the small-flowered species have yellow flowers and beaks shorter than the nutlets. A fourth Sonoran Desert species, K. grandiflora, also has orange flowers but they are much larger, with 2-3 cm petals and much larger beaks, 8-11 mm long.

D. Sundberg 2004). These varieties were treated as species by G. L. Nesom (1994b, 2005d). Variety ligulatum is apparently an obligate outcrosser and is the least variable variety (Sundberg). Other varieties are self-compatible, which could facilitate the fixation of mutations in populations. The five varieties are nearly entirely allopatric, and intermediates between pairs of varieties are not uncommon where they approach one another. Populations that are intermediate in ray lamina size between vars. ligulatum and parviflorum are widespread in southern Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and northern Mexico. Intermediates between vars. elongatum and parviflorum and between vars. elongatum and subulatum occur in Florida. Despite these observations, hybridization experiments and chromosome number differences suggest that the varieties are mostly reproductively isolated (S. D. Sundberg 1986, 2004). In older floras the name Aster exilis Elliott has been applied to Symphyotrichum subulatum vars. ligulatum and parviflorum . The status of this name is uncertain; the type specimen has been lost and the description of the plant is inadequate for determining the taxon to which the name should be applied (G. L. Nesom 1994b; S. D. Sundberg 2004).",,"FNA 2006, McDougall 1973 Duration : Annual Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Herbaceous annuals to biennials, to 150 cm tall, stems usually solitary, glabrous, sometimes with hairs in leaf axils, branches spreading, at least above the middle, plants with taproots.

Stems erect or slightly decumbent, ovoid to cylindric with age, 7.5-17(-30) × (3.3-)3.8-7.5(-10) cm; ribs 8-11(-13), crests uninterrupted or undulate (sometimes depth of sinus between areoles is 90% of rib height in flowering plants with juvenile stem morphology); areoles (12-)15-17(-25) mm apart. Spines (2-)4-12(-16) per areole, straight or curved (radial spines sometimes sinuous); radial spines spreading, opaquely white, commonly with dark stripe on underside, often with contrasting black or brown spines in same areoles (rarely all brown or all white), aging gray; radial spines (2-)4-10(-12) per areole, (8-)11-39 mm; central spines (0-)1(-3) per areole, porrect or ascending, if curved, then usually directed upward, (10-)25-42(-62) mm, abaxial central spine like others in color or darker, flat to sharply angled. Flowers 5-11 × 5-11 cm; flower tube 10-15 × 10-30 mm; flower tube hairs 1-2 mm; inner tepals magenta [or nearly white], proximally sometimes darker or purplish maroon, 30-70 × (9.5-)12-15 mm, tips relatively thin and delicate; anthers yellow; nectar chamber (2-)3.5-6(-8) mm. Fruits bright red, dull carmine, or purplish maroon, less often orange-tan or purplish orange, 20-30(-50) mm, pulp magenta or red. 2 n = 22. Flowering Apr-Jun; fruiting Jun-Aug. Mesquite thickets, semidesert grasslands, interior chaparral, pinyon-juniper or pine-oak woodlands, limestone or igneous substrates, mostly south-facing hillsides; 900-2400 m; Ariz., Colo., N.Mex., Tex.; Mexico (Chihuahua, Sonora). Frequently, some or all spines in each areole of Echinocereus fendleri are opaquely white, especially the lowermost (largest) radial spine, which is frequently strongly flattened (dorsiventrally compressed, its margins expanded and textured spongy or corky). On some immature plants, all the spines are modified in that way, reminiscent of spines of Pediocactus peeblesianus (Croizat) L. D. Benson. Echinocereus fendleri has an indefinite number of (mostly) unnamed geographic races. One of these, var. rectispinus , of southeastern Arizona has enjoyed undeserved emphasis in the literature; it is often based on misidentifications of tetraploid E. fasciculatus . The tuberculate stems and sparse, strangely modified spines of immature plants are retained to some extent in adulthood in some populations of Echinocereus fendleri var. fendleri . Such plants superficially resemble Pediocactus peeblesianaus . The name E. fendleri var. kuenzleri (Castetter, P. Pierce & K. H. Schwerin) L. D. Benson and its Mexican counterpart, E. hempelii Fobe, are based mainly on the stem feature. Immature plants of all populations share that distinctive appearance, strikingly different from immature plants of similar or related species, such as E. fasciculatus. In adulthood this convenient diagnostic characteristic is usually lost, rendering identification more difficult. On the Mexican border immature plants in some populations have as few as four spines per areole ; they probably are intermediates with the obviously conspecific Chihuahuan taxon, E. hempelii Fobe.",,"Benson 1969, FNA 2003, Kearney and Peebles, 1979, Heil et al. 2013, Allred 2012 Common Name : pinkflower hedgehog cactus Duration : Perennial Protected Status : Salvage restriced status in Arizona. General : Hedgehog-like cactus consisting of up to 20 stems of varying heights forming loose clumps (usually 5 or fewer stems per clump), or stems solitary; stems erect to slightly decumbent and flabby, ovoid to cylindric, 7-25 cm tall and 4-8 cm diameter, with 8-11 ribs;  ribs smooth or undulate, with areoles (axillary buds from which the spines emerge) 1- 2 cm apart along the ribs. Spines : Spines usually 4-12 per areole, straight or curved;  central spines 1 or 2 per areole, or absent; the main central spine is up to 6 cm long, nearly terete (round in cross section), sticking straight out or curving upward, and usually dark colored; the second central spine, if present, usually much smaller and lighter in color; remaining spines are radial (emerging from the outside edge of the areole), these are spreading, usually 1-2 cm long, white with a dark stripe on underside, or with contrasting black or brown spines in same areoles (rarely all brown or all white), aging gray. Flowers : Flowers 5-11 cm long and about as wide; petals numerous, 3-7 cm long, magenta to dark purplish maroon, with thin, delicate tips; stamens numerous, topped with yellow anthers. Fruits : Fruit fleshy, 2-3 cm long, maturing bright red to dull carmine or purplish maroon, or even orangish; pulp magenta or red. Ecology : Found in sandy or gravelly soils in a wide variety of ecotypes on mostly south-facing hillsides from 3,000-8,000 ft (914-2438 m); flowers April-June; fruiting June-August. Distribution : CO and UT to TX and n MEX Notes : The systematics of this species (according to some) now include what were previously varieties of E. fasciculatus: var. fasciculatus and var. boyce-thompsonii. These are both rare cacti and are treated as separate species here E. fasciculatus var. fasciculatus has 5-20 stems, each 15-45 cm long, with 8-10 ribs and gray, deflexed spines emerging at right angles from the stem; E. boyce-thompsonii has 4-12 stems, each 10-20 cm long, with 14-18 ribs, a light colored principal stem and slightly longer than E. fasciculatus. Distinguish from E. coccineus by the flower color which is red to orange in that species (never purple-tinged!), while the flowers are pinkish-purple in this species; also the stems are tightly clustered into a mound in E. coccineus, while the stems are loosely clustered or occasionally solitary in this species. Sclerocactus parviflorus has a similar appearance and pink-purple flowers, but in that species the lower central spine is strongly hooked, the source of its common name, fish-hook cactus. Ethnobotany : The fruits were eaten raw or dried, and the stems were pit roasted and eaten. Etymology : Echinocereus is from echinos, spiny, and cereus, candle; fendleri is named for  Augustus Fendler (1813-1883) a German botanical collector in North and Central America.

1021,Bolboschoenus,maritimus,"S. Galen Smith in Flora of North America (vol. 23) Culms 50-150 cm × (1-)3-8 mm.  Leaves: sheaths reaching ± to mid culm, fronts usually membranous at mouth, apex concave to convex, veins diverging proximal to summit leaving triangular, veinless area (often disintegrating); widest blade 2-12 mm wide.  Inflorescences with all spikelets sessile, simply branched with not more than 1/2 of spikelets solitary or in clusters of 2-10 on 1-4 rays, rays not exceeding 8 cm; involucral bracts that surpass inflorescences 1-4, widest bract 1-6 mm wide.   Spikelets (1-)2-40, ovoid to lanceoloid, 7-40 × (4-)7-10 mm, base usually cuneate to rounded; scales often loosely imbricate, bright orange-brown to stramineous, often obscurely lineolate-spotted, 5-8 × 3-4 mm, membranous, translucent, apex acute, 2-fid 0.5-1 mm deep, awn slender, 1-3 × 0.25 mm at base.  Flowers: perianth bristles not persistent on shed achenes or sometimes 1-few weakly persistent, medium brown, to 1/2 achene length; anthers yellow, very rarely orange, 2-4 mm; styles 2-3-fid.  Achenes medium to dark brown, rarely yellowish or whitish, obovoid, biconvex, or concave-sided, rarely obtusely compressed trigonous, 2.3-4.1 × 1.9-2.8 mm, apex rounded to nearly truncate, beak 0.1-0.4 mm, surface glossy, exocarp (epidermal) cells usually clearly visible at 10-20X; in achene cross section exocarp 2 times as thick as mesocarp, its cells greatly enlarged, at least 3 times deeper than wide; achene specific gravity much less than water. Bolboschoenus maritimus belongs to a difficult, worldwide complex, in which the delimitation of specific and infraspecific taxa is still unclear.  The new lectotype and epitype from the Baltic coast of Sweden selected by S. G. Smith and I. Kukkonen (1999) are used here as the basis for redefining B. maritimus subsp. maritimus, which was previously defined to include B. yagara (Ohwi) Y. C. Yang & M. Zhan (J. Browning et al. 1996; Z. Hroudová et al. 1998). It seems likely that some populations of both Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp. maritimus and B. maritimus subsp. paludosus have been introduced into the flora from Eurasia. Putative Bolboschoenus maritimus × B. robustus hybrids are common in zones of sympatry along the northern Atlantic Coast and in California, putative B. fluviatilis × B. maritimus hybrids occur in California, and many B. glaucus × B. maritimus hybrids occur in California and Idaho (J. Browning et al. 1995).  They are intermediate between their putative parents in every character studied and are often fertile.  Interspecific hybridization is probably responsible for much of the infraspecific variation in B. maritimus, especially along the northern Atlantic and California coasts.  The orange anthers and few 3-fid styles on some specimens from southeastern Texas may be due to introgression from B. robustus.  The type of Scirpus maritimus forma agonus Fernald is probably a B. maritimus × B. robustus hybrid. Bolboschoenus maritimus and B. robustus have been widely confused in the southwest, where some authors (e.g., H. L. Mason 1957; P. A. Munz 1959, 1968) have treated B. maritimus as a synonym of B. robustus, and others (D. S. Correll and H. B. Correll  1972) have treated B. robustus as B. maritimus var. macrostachyus Michaux. No acceptably vouchered chromosome counts for Bolboschoenus maritimus are available from North America. The voucher for the 2n = 90 count by N. A. Harriman (1981) from southeastern Texas is a mixed collection of B. maritimus subsp. paludosus and B. robustus.  Reasonably reliable chromosome numbers reported for B. maritimus in Europe are mostly 2n = 108 or 110, but vary from 2n = 55 to 112 (V. Jarolímová and Z. Hroudová 1998).",,,Bolboschoenus maritimus,CYPERACEAE,perennial,non-native,1,grass,0.0,2000.0

Three varieties of Schoenoplectus pungens (under Scirpus americanus) were recognized for North America by T. Koyama (1963), and three more or less equivalent varieties were recognized by S. G. Smith (1995).  These varieties are described informally and illustrated here but not formally recognized because their morphologic delimitation should be evaluated and their exact ranges are still uncertain. Schoenoplectus pungens (Vahl) Palla var. pungens has  brown to straw-colored spikelet scales, bifid styles, and lenticular achenes.  It is the only variety that occurs in Europe and North America.  In North America, it extends from the Atlantic Coast to Saskatoon and is reported from Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Missouri. Schoenoplectus pungens (Vahl) Palla var. longispicatus (Britton) S. G. Smith has bright orange to reddish (or purplish) brown or often stramineus and lineolate-spotted spikelet scales, trifid styles, and trigonous to lenticular achenes. Endemic to the flora area, variety longispicatus occurs in western North America, except Pacific Coast, east to Saskatoon, Manitoba, and Ontario, along the north shore of Lake Superior, south to Iowa, Minnesota, western Wisconsin, Missouri, and southern Mississippi. Schoenoplectus pungens  (Vahl) Palla var. badius (J. Presl & C. Presl) S. G. Smith has uniformly dark chestnut spikelet scales, trifid styles 3-fid, and trigonous or thickly biconvex achenes. In North America, variety badius occurs along the Pacific Coast (to slightly inland) from British Columbia south to California.  Outside the flora area it occurs in Baja California, Mexico, temperate South America, Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand. The name Scirpus americanus [subsp. monophyllus (J. Presl & C. Presl) T. Koyama] var. monophyllus was misapplied to Schoenoplectus pungens  var.  badius (T. Koyama 1963).  The type of the basionym Scirpus monophyllus J. Presl & C. Presl from Peru belongs to Schoenoplectus americanus (S. G. Smith 1995). Schoenoplectus americanus, S. pungens, and S. deltarum belong to the small 'Scirpus americanus complex' T. Koyama (1963), in which the species are sometimes difficult to delimit.  Schoenoplectus pungens was long known incorrectly as S. americanus Persoon; the type of that name is conspecific with plants formerly treated as S. olneyi  A. Gray (A. E. Schuyler 1974).  Putative Schoenoplectus pungens × S. americanus hybrids [= S. ×contortus (Eames) S. G.

Distribution : Most of western US, from TX west to CA and north to WA; also in northeastern US. Notes : This plant is stemless for the most part above the ground. The leaves grow directly from the base of the plant in bunches (tufted, or caespitose) and are long-petioled and elliptic, with edges that are toothed and densely hairy; flowers large and white, with a long hypanthium tube which emerges from the base of the plant; later maturing into a hard, sessile fruit which is buried in the leaves. Numerous subspecies are found in the region. Oenothera albicaulis can appear similar and be nearly stemless with basal leaves, but that species is annual and Oe. cespitosa is perennial. Ethnobotany : Used for healing, for ceremonies, as a gynecological aid, and for sores. Etymology : Oenothera comes from the Greek oinos, wine, and therao, to seek or imbibe, alluding to the fact that the root of Oenothera biennis was used to flavor wine; cespitosa means having a densely clumped, tufted or cushion-like growth form.

Leaves : Alternate and sessile, clustered at the base and scattered along the stems; blades linear, usually 1 mm wide or less, 5-30 mm long, and rough-hairy, the hairs bulbous-based. Flowers : White, in numerous short scorpioid spikes, these elongating in fruit; calyx lobes lance-linear, 1-1.5 mm long at anthesis, hispid with stiff spreading hairs; corolla white, funnelform, about 1.5 mm long, the limb 1.5-2 mm broad.

Distribution : c and s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, s NM, s TX; south to n MEX. Notes : Cryptantha is a genus of bristly herbs with white or yellow flowers in spikes that are usually 1-sided and curling like a scorpion-s tail (-scorpioid-). The seeds, called -nutlets- in the borage family, are crucial to identification of the species. As the nutlets are quite small and difficult to examine in the field with a hand lens, it is usually necessary to make a collection of mature material for later identification under a dissecting scope. C. angustifolia is distinguished by a being slender-stemmed, much-branched annual, mostly decumbent or ascending; having a bractless inflorescence; calyx lobes not recurving; 4 dark nutlets per flower, one usually a bit bigger than the others, all of them tuberculate (covered in bumps, which are lighter in color than the rest of the nutlet) and with the style reaching to just beyond the tip of the larger nutlet. Appears similar to C. micrantha but that the roots of that species are always charged with red dye, and the plant is generally smaller, with all the leaves less than 1 cm long and nutlets 1 mm long.

Leaves : Opposite and short-petiolate, located almost entirely at nodes where the stem forks into 2 branches; blades narrowly linear, 1-2 cm long, the margins entire and tightly revolute (curled under), and the midvein impressed on the upper surface of the leaf; stipules narrow and tapering toward the tip, 0.5 mm long. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In E. revoluta, the cyathia (flower structures) are mostly solitary in the nodes near branch tips. Involucres are cone-shaped, 1 mm high, and glabrous, with 4 round glands around the edge, each with a white petaloid appendage which is a bit wider than the gland (or petaloid appendages absent); 5-10 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsules globose and 3-lobed, to 1.5 mm high, and glabrous; containing 3 ovoid, white to gray seeds, to 1.5 mm long, 3-angled and transversely 2-3-ridged. Ecology : Found on arid hillsides and slopes, from 3,000-6,000 ft (914-1829 m); flowers August-October. Distribution : s CA, s UT, AZ, s CO, NM, TX; south to n MEX. Notes : This species belongs to the Chamaesyce subgenus of Euphorbia. Some treatments, even recent ones, continue to treat Chamaesyce as a separate genus even though molecular evidence places it within Euphorbia. Chamaesyce spp are distinct based on their leaves which are always opposite and and often have asymmetric bases; cyathia (flower structures) in leaf axils, not at branch tips, and usually with petaloid appendages; and stipules present and not gland-like. E revoluta is distinguished by being a delicate, erect, hairless annual with slender, linear leaves. The entire plant often has a reddish/maroon tint, and the stems fork evenly into two branches multiple times, with a pair of leaves and often a single cyathium (flower-like structure) at each fork point. It is wise to make a collection whenever ID to species is needed, as Chamaesyces are difficult to identify in the field, and multiple species of the genus will commonly grow side-by-side. Ethnobotany : Used as a lotion for chafing and sores. Etymology : Euphorbia is named for Euphorbus, Greek physician of Juba II, King of Mauretania; revoluta means rolled backwards, referring to the revolute margins of the meaves.

Leaves : Alternate along the branchlets, on glabrous to hairy petioles 1-9 mm long; stipules leaflike or absent; blades linear to ligulate, 3-16 cm long and 2-9 mm wide, 10-28 times as long as wide; lower leaf surface glaucous or densely silky to silky-villous; upper surface shiny; young leaves long-silky. Flowers : Catkins develop at the same time as leaves in the spring, or after the leaves are fully developed; catkins 2.5-5 cm long, each flower subtended by a greenish, whitish, yellowish, or tawny bract, 1-3 mm long, glabrous or hairy; floral bracts on female flowers fall off soon after flowering. Fruits : Capsule 3-7 mm long, glabrous or hairy; splitting into 2 sections to release many cottony seeds. Ecology : Found in thickets along watercourses from 1,000-8,500 ft (305-2591 m); flowers March-June. Distribution : Most of western N. Amer, from CA east to TX and north to CAN; south to n MEX. Notes : This is one of two willows that can be found along low-elevation rivers in the Southwest. The other, S. gooddingii, grows into a well-developed tree with lanceolate leaves 9-16 mm wide, with toothed edges. S. exigua, in contrast, is clonal and tends to grow in dense thickets; it never grows into a well developed tree, but instead has many woody stems only a few centimeters in diameter; and the leaves are much narrower, only 2-9 mm wide. Look also for the young branches which are often distinctly red-brown. There are two varieties: var. exigua has silky white hairs on the leaf underside, while var. interior has leaves that are hairless underneath. Ethnobotany : Twigs used to build sweathouses for rheumatism and colds; the bark was used to treat fevers, coughs, venereal diseases, and sore throats, and was taken as an emetic; the young twigs were used to make baskets, mats, and cordage. Etymology : Salix is the classical Latin name for willow trees, perhaps derived from salio, to leap or spring, from the quickness of their growth; exigua means little, or weak in growth. Synonyms : Salix argophylla, Salix exigua var. angustissima, Salix exigua var. columbiana, Salix exigua var. hindsiana, Salix exigua var. luteosericea, Salix exigua var. nevadensis, Salix exigua var. parishiana, Salix exigua var. stenophylla, Salix exigua var. viren Editor : SBuckley 2010, FSCoburn 2015, AHazelton 2017",Salix exigua,SALICACEAE,perennial,native,1,tree,5.0,2591.0
