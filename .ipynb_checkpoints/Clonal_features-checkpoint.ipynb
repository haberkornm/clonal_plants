Leaves : Opposite along the stems, on petioles less than 1 mm long; blades orbicular to oblong, 3-8 mm long, with a strongly asymmetric base and entire margins, often with a red blotch in the center; stipules united into a membranous, white, triangular or ovate scale, about 1 mm long. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In E. albomarginata, the cyathia (modified flowers) are solitary in the leaf axils. Involucres are bell-shaped, and 1 mm high, and glabrous, with 4 green-yellow to red oblong glands around the edge, each with a conspicuous white to pink petaloid appendage which often has a toothed edge; 15-30 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsule 3-chambered, broadly ovoid, 2 mm long, glabrous, the angles acute; seeds 4-sided, oblong, smooth and whitish, 1-2 mm long. Ecology : Found in open, sandy or gravelly dry places up through the pinon-juniper zone, from 1,000-7,000 ft (305-2135 m); flowers April-September. Distribution : s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, NM, TX, OK; south to c MEX. Notes : This species belongs to the Chamaesyce subgenus of Euphorbia. Some treatments, even recent ones, treat Chamaesyce as a separate genus even though molecular evidence places it within Euphorbia. Chamaesyce spp are distinct based on their leaves which are always opposite and and often have asymmetric bases; cyathia (flower structures) in leaf axils, not at branch tips, and usually with petaloid appendages; and stipules present and not gland-like. E. albomarginata is a common and widespread species in the west, distinguished by being a prostrate perennial without any hairs on the stems, leaves, or seed pods; the cyathia (modified flowers) with large white petaloid appendages (look like petals); and stipules that unite to form a white papery scale between the leaf pairs where they attach to the stem (in other species there is a separate stipule at the base of each petiole). The FNA treatment states that the leaves have white margins (hence the specific epithet) but this trait is not particularly obvious on most specimens. It is wise to make a collection whenever ID to species is needed, as Chamaesyces are difficult to identify in the field, and multiple species of the genus will commonly grow side-by-side. Ethnobotany : Diegueno brew plant into tea to treat sores. Shoshoni and Kawaitsu use leaves and flowers for snakebite. Keres treat eye problems by rub from plant. Navajo use slow tea from whole plant for colds or stomachaches. Etymology : Euphorbia is named for Euphorbus, Greek physician of Juba II, King of Mauretania, while albomarginata refers to white margins.

Vegetative : Blades 3-6 mm wide, flat, glabrous, with purple bands where the ligules should be and sometimes elsewhere on the leaves; sheath compressed, open, glabrous; collar glabrous. Inflorescence : Panicle 6-15 cm long, with short, simple, subspicate branches; branches widely spaced, appressed to rachis or spreading; spikelets 3 mm long, often suffused with purple, dorsally compressed to terete, subsessile and crowded in two to four regular rows on one side of the branch (secund), with 2 florets, the lower sterile or staminate and the upper fertile; disarticulating below the glumes at maturity; second glume and sterile lemma short-pointed, hispid-scabrous to glabrous, loosely enclosing mature caryopsis; fertile lemma abruptly cuspidate. Ecology : Found on moist, disturbed soils, ditchbanks, irrigated fields below 5,500 ft (1676 m); flowers May-October. Distribution : Of obscure origin; naturalized throughout the world; in N. Amer. from OR south to CA, east to NY; south through MEX to S. America. Notes : Similar to Panicum and Setaria due to the hard single-seeded spikelets; however, the one-sided racemes, lack of ligules, large, round, pointed spikelets and lack of subtending bristles separate it from those two genera. Distinguish from E. crusgalli by the more slender culms 20-60 cm (vs stout culms 50-125 cm in E. crus-galli), narrower blades < 6 mm, shorter panicle branches < 3 cm (compared to E. crusgalli-s longer, often re-branched panicle branches 3-6 cm long), and the lack of awns. E. crus-galli is sometimes awnless but usually has awns, which can vary in length on the same branch and be as long as 5 cm. A worldwide weed of wet areas, this species is especially considered a pest in rice fields, but is edible and has been domesticated and cultivated in parts of the old world. Ethnobotany : Cocopa parched the seeds, ground them into flour for mush. Cultivated as a cereal grain in India, Egypt. Etymology : Echinochloa is from Greek for hedgehog or sea-urchin and chloe or chloa grass, referring to bristly spikelets; colona is from Latin colonus for colonist, referring to the plant-s cosmopolitan distribution.

Distribution : SD to MO and AL, west to CO and AZ; south to n MEX. Also in cultivation. Notes : This fairly common perennial is hard to miss with its showy, nectiferous purple flowers and hairy, pinnately lobed leaves. It is distinguished from other Glandularia, especially G. gooddingii, by the floral bracts being slightly longer than the calyx, and the herbage being hirsute, and not glandular. There are a number of varieties which have been recognized as distinct species at one time or another. Neesom (2010) completed a treatment for the complex, some of which was incorporated into Allred and Ivey (2012) but differences amonth the taxa are subtle. Ethnobotany : Leaves rubbed on snakebites; used to make a gargle for sore throat and as a life medicine.

Ecology : Found on dry rocky slopes, below 5,000 ft (1524 m); flowers August-December. Distribution : AZ, NM, TX; south through Greater Antilles, MEX, C. Amer. to n S. Amer. Notes : This species is a part of a group of Bouteloua very similar in appearance being perennials with short inflorescence branches (sometimes appearing as clusters of spikelets) on both sides of the axis and are deciduous, completely falling off and leaving a small nodule behind.  Distinguished from the similar B. radicosa and B. chondrosioides by often having less hair along the rachilla of the spikelets, and most hair restricted to the rachilla and midnerve of the lemmas; 7 - 12  spikate branches; from B. radicosa by lacking a hard, knotty, rhizomotous base; and a generally yellowish or grayish tinge, with often thinner leaves than the others. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genus have many uses. Etymology : Bouteloua named for brothers Claudio (1774-1842) and Esteban (1776-1813) Boutelou Agraz, Spanish botanists and horticulturalists; repens means having creeping and rooting stems.

       "        'Wiggins 1964,  Allred and Ivey 2012, Jepson eFlora (Keil et al. 2017), FNA 2016 Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Forb/Herb General : Mat-forming perennial herbs with thickened rootstock; stems prostrate and freely branched, 5-80 cm long, often rooting at the nodes; herbage glabrous and often glaucous. Leaves : Opposite along the stems, on petioles less than 1 mm long; blades orbicular to oblong, 3-8 mm long, with a strongly asymmetric base and entire margins, often with a red blotch in the center; stipules united into a membranous, white, triangular or ovate scale, about 1 mm long. Flowers : Has the highly modified flower structure characteristic of Euphorbias. Structures called cyathia appear to be individual flowers, but are composed of fused-together bracts forming a cup (involucre), with peripheral nectary glands which are often subtended by petal-like bracts called petaloid appendages. Within the cup there is a ring of inconspicuous male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen. Out of the middle protrudes a single, stalked female flower which lacks petals. In E. albomarginata, the cyathia (modified flowers) are solitary in the leaf axils. Involucres are bell-shaped, and 1 mm high, and glabrous, with 4 green-yellow to red oblong glands around the edge, each with a conspicuous white to pink petaloid appendage which often has a toothed edge; 15-30 staminate flowers. Fruits : Capsule 3-chambered, broadly ovoid, 2 mm long, glabrous, the angles acute; seeds 4-sided, oblong, smooth and whitish, 1-2 mm long. Ecology : Found in open, sandy or gravelly dry places up through the pinon-juniper zone, from 1,000-7,000 ft (305-2135 m); flowers April-September. Distribution : s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, NM, TX, OK; south to c MEX. Notes : This species belongs to the Chamaesyce subgenus of Euphorbia. Some treatments, even recent ones, treat Chamaesyce as a separate genus even though molecular evidence places it within Euphorbia. Chamaesyce spp are distinct based on their leaves which are always opposite and and often have asymmetric bases; cyathia (flower structures) in leaf axils, not at branch tips, and usually with petaloid appendages; and stipules present and not gland-like. E. albomarginata is a common and widespread species in the west, distinguished by being a prostrate perennial without any hairs on the stems, leaves, or seed pods; the cyathia (modified flowers) with large white petaloid appendages (look like petals); and stipules that unite to form a white papery scale between the leaf pairs where they attach to the stem (in other species there is a separate stipule at the base of each petiole). The FNA treatment states that the leaves have white margins (hence the specific epithet) but this trait is not particularly obvious on most specimens. It is wise to make a collection whenever ID to species is needed, as Chamaesyces are difficult to identify in the field, and multiple species of the genus will commonly grow side-by-side. Ethnobotany : Diegueno brew plant into tea to treat sores. Shoshoni and Kawaitsu use leaves and flowers for snakebite. Keres treat eye problems by rub from plant. Navajo use slow tea from whole plant for colds or stomachaches. Etymology : Euphorbia is named for Euphorbus, Greek physician of Juba II, King of Mauretania, while albomarginata refers to white margins.

Inflorescence : Panicles 6-22 cm long, 2.5-12 cm wide; primary branches to 11 cm; pedicels, secondary branches, and ends of primary branches are capillary; pedicels to 6 mm, usually hairy near the end, the hairs up to 6 mm long; spikelets 2-6 mm, 2-flowered, with hairy calluses; lower glumes tiny, pubescent, with rounded apices; upper glumes 2.5-5 mm, enclosing upper florets, densely pubescent with hairs to 7 mm, varying from white to rose or darkish purple, unawned or with awns to 4 mm; lower florets sterile, the lemmas unawned or with awns to 4 mm; upper florets bisexual, the lemmas 2 mm, unawned, glabrous. Ecology : Found on rocky slopes and in moist canyon bottoms from 2,500-4,500 ft (762-1372 m); flowers July-November. Distribution : Native to Africa and West Asia; Introduced to subtropical regions worldwide; in the southern US, from CA east to NC; south through the Greater Antilles, MEX, into S. Amer.; also in Europe, Asia and Australia. Notes : This attractive exotic grass is like no other, with its open, drooping pink-silvery inflorescence which glimmers in the sun. This species has naturalized in the southwest after being seeded for range improvement. Ethnobotany : Valued as livestock fodder in Africa; used in making banana beer in Tanganyika. Etymology : Melinis comes from Greek mel for honey, the genus are also known as molasses grass, while repens means having rooting or creeping stems.
