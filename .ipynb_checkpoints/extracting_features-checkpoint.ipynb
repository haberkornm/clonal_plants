Small straight spines borne singly at nodes. Bark of twigs and branches bluish green, while older trunks are often gray. Leaves : Leaves are pinnate with single pair of pinnae, with 2-4 pairs of obovate leaflets 4-8 mm long, darkening when dried. Flowers : Found in terminal racemes, 22-28 mm wide, calyx green to yellow-green, lobes reflexed; Petals bright yellow, banner with small orange-red spots basally. Fruits : Straw colored oblong pods 4-10 cm long moderately flattened, mostly indehiscent, seeds 1-6. Ecology : Generally found along washes, plains, and canyons, sometimes on slopes from sea level to 4,000 ft (1219 m); flowers March-April. Distribution : s and w AZ, se CA, Sonora and Baja Calif., MEX. Notes : Leafy branches not or not strongly spine-tipped, the rudimentary branches transformed into spines. Mostly grows along dry washes, less common on upland slopes. Has bluish-green bark, leaflets 4-8 mm long, flowers 12-17 mm long with all petals the same bright yellow color and flat seed pods with short triangular beaks or without beaks. Compare to P. microphylla which has yellowish green bark, smaller leaflets < 3 mm long, smaller flowers < 10 mm long which often have one white petal among the yellow petals, and turgid (inflated) seed pods ending in a flat triangular or sword-shaped beak. Ethnobotany : The seeds were dried and roasted before being ground into meal for mush or cakes. Green pods can be eaten raw, similar to edamame (soybean) in texture.  The wood was used for carving ladles. Etymology : Parkinsonia is named after John Parkinson (1567-1650), florida refers to either free-flowering, abundant flowers or bright.

Leaves : Borne on thorn tipped stems, lacking a petiole with 1 pair of pinnae, each 1-5 cm and with 4-8 pairs of leaflets, leaflets 1-3.5 mm broadly elliptic to broadly oblong or orbicular. Flowers : Bicolored with four yellow petals and one white banner, 12-18 mm wide. Fruits : Pods, sparsely pubescent, tan to straw-colored 4-8 cm long, indehiscent. Ecology : Abundant on bajadas, plains and hillslopes through low desert from 500-3,500 ft (152-1067 m); flowers April-May. Distribution : s and w AZ, se CA, Sonora and Baja Calif., MEX. Notes : A dominant on the dry rocky hillsides of the Sonoran Desert.

       "       'Wiggins 1964, Benson and Darrow 1981, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Common Name : Jerusalem thorn Duration : Perennial Nativity : Native Lifeform : Tree Wetland Status : FAC General : Trees with well-developed trunk smooth, green bark on upper branches and brown, rough bark on trunk and main limbs, to 12 m tall.  Young twigs have paired nodal, spines with small white hairs, soon becoming glabrous. Leaves : Leaves obscurely twice-pinnate, with reduced primary rachis, 1-3 flattened pinnae, up to 30 cm long, with 10-40 pairs of ephemeral leaflets 2-8 mm long. Flowers : On racemes 10-16 cm, relatively few-flowered; showy, 27-35 mm wide, sepals and petals yellow, banner petal at first with basal red-orange spots or flecks, anthers pale orange to somewhat rose colored. Fruits : Pods few seeded, more or less indehiscent or tardily semidehiscent. Ecology : Found along arroyos, sandy plains, or other low-lying areas where water accumulates in the low desert from 3,000-4,500 ft (914-1372 m); flowers March-May, occasionally post-monsoon. Distribution : Most states in southern US, from CA, NV, AZ and UT, east to FL; south to s MEX, and in S. Amer.; Europe; Africa and Australia. Notes : Distinguished by being a tree with photosynthetic, green bark and showy yellow flowers much like other Parkinsonia, but highly distinct by the very-long leaves (to 30 cm) with flattened, >10 cm long rachis of pinna, alternate leaflets and the brown bark on the trunk and main branches.
