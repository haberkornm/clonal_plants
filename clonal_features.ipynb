Leaves : Usually in a basal cluster, the blades 4-10 cm long, 2 or 3 times pinnately dissected with ca. 4 opposite pairs of lateral primary leaflets; leaflets crowded, the ultimate segments oblong, generally less than 3 mm long, ending abruptly in a small point. Flowers : White, in compact umbels at early anthesis, becoming more open; peduncles exceed leaves with an involucel of conspicuous, linear and distinct, or obovate and connate, scarious-margined bractlets, about equaling the flowers; rays 8-22, spreading, 1-2.5 cm long, unequal in length; pedicels 3-10 mm long; each cluster of umbels about 20 flowered, corolla white to cream. Fruits : Capsule splitting into 2 single seeded mericarps, ovate to oblong-obovate, 6-8 mm long, 4-6 mm broad, the marginal ribs winged, wings narrower than body. Ecology : Found on rocky slopes and mesas from 3,000-7,000 ft (914-2134 m); flowers March-May. Distribution : s CA, s NV, s UT, AZ, w NM, south to Sonora, MEX. Notes : This taxon is distinguished by its low, stemless (except for the flowering stalks) growth form, grayish pubescent herbage, 2 or 3 times dissected leaves and white flowers. There are two varieties, though Jepson notes that the varieties are poorly defined and Welsh et al notes some confusion as to which varieties are represented in Utah; var. parishii has glabrous ovaries and fruits and is more widespread; var. nevadense has pubescent fruits. Ethnobotany : The roots were eaten raw like radishes, or cooked in the sand and eaten, and the roots used for viral respiratory infections. Etymology : Lomatium is from the Greek loma for bordered, from the prominent marginal fruit wings; nevadense means of or from Nevada.

Stems, if present, decumbent, aerial or subterranean, simple to sometimes branched, to 2 m long. Leaves : Blades erect, bluish green, concave-convex (crescent shaped in cross section), 30-100 cm long by 2-6 cm wide, rigid, scabrous or glaucous, margins brown and fibrous. Flowers : Paniculate inflorescence arising from within, extending beyond rosettes, ovoid in outline, 60-80 cm, glabrous, rarely pubescent; peduncle scapelike, to 0.8 m; flowers pendant, 5-13 cm, the tepals connate at base, campanulate, cream-colored, occasionally tinged with purple. Fruits : Fleshy, banana-shaped fruit, 5-23 cm long by 4-8 cm wide; pendant. Ecology : Found on slopes and flats in a variety of different soil types from 3,000-8,000 ft (914-2438 m); flowers April-July. Distribution : s CA and s NV, east to sw CO, NM and w TX. Notes : Common and widespread in the southwest, distinguished by the curling fibers on the leaf edges; thicker, coarser leaves than other yuccas in the area, and large pendant white flowers followed by large, green, hanging fruits. There are two varieties; Y. baccata var. baccata, the more widespread form, is acaulescent or has up to 6 short stems less than 30 cm long and course, curling threads on the leaf margins.  Y. b. var. brevifolia, found in SE Arizona and SW New Mexico, is most definitely caulescent, with up to 24 stems which can be as tall as 2 meters, and fine threads on the leaf margins. Ethnobotany : Used as a shampoo, as an antiemetic, for heartburn, as a cathartic, in childbirth, ceremonially, and as a drink. The fruits were roasted and eaten, as well as eaten raw, boiled, or baked, pulverized and dried in cakes; its use as a food is extensive throughout the region. Used for making fibers, rope, mats, sandals, and baskets; used also as an ingredient in dyes. Etymology : Yucca comes from Haitian word yuca, or manihot, because young inflorescences are sometimes roasted for food, while baccata means having pulpy, berry-like fruits, from Latin bacca, for small, round fruit.

Leaves : Clustered in a basal rosette, blades 60-120 cm long, 6-12 mm wide, margins unevenly serrulate-scabrous, tips split into tufts 5-12 cm long; narrow channels run the length of the leaf. Flowers : Scapes erect, to 1.5 m tall; panicles narrow, the primary branches 15-50 cm long, ascending; secondary branches one-half as long; bracts subtending lower branches lance-linear, 5-12 mm wide, 8-15 cm long, attenuate; flowers campanulate, whitish, 2-4 mm long, tepals oblong to ovate. Fruits : Capsules subglobose, papery and inflated, deeply notched at apex, rounded to shallowly notched at base, 4-5 mm high, 6-8 mm wide, 3-locular with 3 seeds; seeds compressed, 2-3 mm. Ecology : Found on rocky slopes and hills from 3,000-6,000 ft (914-1829 m); flowers May-July. Distribution : s UT, AZ, NM; south to n MEX. Notes : This is a widespread species in the southwest, distinguished by its rosette of drooping leaves with small prickles on margins, and the inflorescence stalk to 1.5 m tall with a branched panicle of small white flowers at the end. The drooping leaves distinguish it from Yucca, Agave, and Dasylirion, which all have stiff, erect leaves. There are a few other species of Nolina in the Southwest; N. microcarpa is the most common, and is distinguished by the woody trunk being underground; leaves < 12 mm wide; and serrulate leaf margins. Ethnobotany : Taken for rheumatism, for pneumonia and lung hemorrhages; the stalks were eaten; the seeds were made a flour or meal for bread or mush; the fruit was eaten raw or preserved; plant was used as a dye, for basketry, rugs, mats and other forms of weaving, for brushes, rope, and cord; the roots were used for soap; and the dried leaves were used as cooking tools. Etymology : Nolina is named for Abbe Pierre Charles Nolin (b. 1717) a French arboriculturalist, while microcarpa means having small fruits or seed pods.

Plants dioeceous. Leaves : Linear, basally clumped, elongated, rigid, about 1 m long and 3-4 cm broad, whitish to bluish green, waxy, the margins armed with sharp, curved spines that point toward the leaf apex. Flowers : Large terminal panicles, on stalks 1.5-5 m tall; male panicles composed of catkinlike spikes. Perianth about 2 mm long, sepals and petals thin, whitish, sometime tinged purple. Fruits : Capsule 7-9 mm long, 6-8 mm broad, 1-celled, 3-winged. Ecology : Found on rocky or gravelly hillsides and slopes from 3,000-6,000 ft (914-1829 m); flowers May-July. Distribution : c and s AZ, NM; south to n MEX. Notes : This is a ubiquitous shrub of Chihuahuan scrub and semidesert grasslands. Distinguish from Yucca and Nolina by larger, curved teeth on leaf margins and from Agave by the leaves being thin, not succulent. The dense, rounded rosette of blue-green toothed leaves is distinctive, as is the large stalk with a dense raceme of smallish white flowers at the end.  D. wheeleri is the only native Dasylirion in Arizona, and is widely used in landscaping. One other Dasylirion is present in New Mexico; D. leiophyllum can be found it the SE part of the state, and is distinguished by its bright green (not glaucous) leaves with marginal teeth usually pointed toward the base of the leaf. Ethnobotany : Crowns pit-baked, crushed, and fermented for use as a beverage. Stalks roasted, boiled, eaten raw. Stalks used for cradleboard backs, as a source for material for basketry, mats, and for ceremonial purposes. Etymology : Dasylirion comes from the Greek root dasys -shaggy, thick, hairy, rough-, while wheeleri is named for George Wheeler (1842-1905) an early American explorer.
