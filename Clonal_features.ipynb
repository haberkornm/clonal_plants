Distinguished by its perennial, stoloniferous and rhizomotous growth habit with culms and runners creeping long distances, becoming tangled, and producing dense growth and forming beds or mats in the right conditions. The inflorescence is distinct, too, with a panicle of 2-9 digitate branches with spikelets densely packed in 2 rows and florets containing pubescent lemmas and lacking awns.  Another widespread weed, Chloris virgata, has a similar digitate inflorescence. However C. virgata is an annual grass with awned spikelets, while C. dactylon is perennial and awnless. Ethnobotany : In India, juice pressed from the leaves, seeds, and flowers is mixed with sugar and taken for nausea. Etymology : Cynodon is from Greek meaning dog-s tooth, a traditional common name for the grass in Europe; and dactylon is from Greek daktylos, or finger, referring to the digitate inflorescence.

Distribution : Native to Africa, w Asia, and India; introduced throughout the warmer, drier regions of the world including the sw US from CA to TX. Notes : This plant is said to be rapidly altering the fire regime of the Sonoran Desert by increasing the fine fuel load and having the ability to resprout after fire more quickly than many native plants. This is causing enormous concern from land managers and environmentalists, and extensive control and removal efforts are underway in southern Arizona. The species was introduced by the US Soil Conservation Service to rehabilitate overgrazed rangeland, and was still being seeded in the southwestern US into the 1980s. The Mexicans continue to seed depleted rangeland with this species. Technicians and volunteers spraying herbicide or digging up this plant are often instructed to look for the naked zig-zag rachis to help with identification during the off-season; however, it is important to be aware that other grass genera have zig-zag rachises, specifically the native Hilaria spp. (AKA Pleuraphis spp., commonly known as galleta grass, tobosa grass, and curly mesquite grass). Killers of buffelgrass should familiarize themselves with these native grasses, which have naked rachises that are more deeply zig-zagging than buffelgrass, and never have any bristles clinging to the inflorescences.

In this species, disarticulation is usually beneath the sessile spikelets, but sometimes also beneath the pedicellate spikelets. Sessile spikelets are 4-6 mm long, with 2 florets, the first sterile and reduced to a hyaline lemma, and the second fertile. Glumes of sessile spikelets are subequal, broad, coreaceous;  lemma of fertile floret membranous, usually with a twisted, once-geniculate awn up to 13 mm long, this readily deciduous.

Distribution : Native to the Mediterranean and naturalized around the world in warm-temperate regions.  Found in Ontario and every state in the US, south to South America. Notes : A robust perennial grass distinguished by being rhizomotous and tall, up to 2 m; with ciliate ligules, and pyramidal, open inflorescences bearing pedicillate-sessile spikelet pairs which are hairy and have twisted awns. The entire inflorescence usually has a conspicuous reddish color. The species is considered to be highly invasive, and commonly found along irrigation ditches and in floodplains in the Southwest. Johnson grass was historically cultivated for hay and forage but is no longer recommended for planting due to its invasiveness and ability to form stable hybrids with S. bicolor (cultivated sorghum). Also, at certain developmental stages and under some adverse environmental conditions, Johnson grass may form cyanogenetic glycosides that can poison livestock. It also appears to sequester selenium and other elements that are toxic at high doses when growing in soils with high concentrations of those elements, making it potentially useful for mine reclamation.

America, especially common in the Great Plains and Southwest; from Canada south through Mexico to western S. America. Notes : Side-oats gramma is a descriptive common name due to the inflorescence which has 20-50 small branches, each with 2-7 spikelets(these can appear as clusters of spikelets at first and not branches) which dangle off of one side of the inflorescence axis. The small branches are deciduous, and leave a narrow zig-zag pattern with small nodules where they have detached. It is a perennial with leaf-blades 2-7 mm wide and flat, not rolled. This is a quite common species, being widespread and often abundant where it occurs. There are two varieties in Arizona: var. curtipendula and var. caespitosa. Var. curtipendula can be distinguished by being long-rhizomatous, with stems solitary or in small clumps. Var. caespitosa are not long-rhizomatous, though the bases are sometimes knotty with short rhizomes, and stems are in large or small clumps. A third variety, var. tenuis is endemic to Mexico, but a single collection has been made in the Huachuca Mountains. This variety does not have very long rhizomes, and has conspicuously curled blades.

Seinet now lumps this species and V. catenata into V. grandiflora, but at the time of this description, neither Tropicos nor any recent regional floras recognize that change. V. catenata has narrower lanceolate leaves; smaller flowers with corollas 3-5 mm wide; racemes with fewer than 25 flowers; and pedicels that are straight or spreading. Ethnobotany : Leaves are edible raw or cooked; used medicinally to improve appetite, as a blood tonic, to improve urine flow, and to treat burns and skin ulcers. Etymology : Veronica is named for Saint Veronica; anagallis-aquatica means water-pimpernel, and is named for its resemblance to the genus Anagallis, common name pimpernel, in the Primrose family.

Molecular evidence shows that species traditionally placed in the genus Cheilanthes are not all from a single evolutionary lineage, so botanists are in the process of splitting up the genus. The result is that most North American Cheilanthes are very recently placed in the genus Myriopteris. This species can be distinguished by the tiny bead-like leaflets appearing glabrous and green on the upper surface, and being covered with light brown scales on the lower surface; also the frond stalks are covered with brown scales which look a bit like hairs to the naked eye; use your hand lens to see the scales!

       "        \"FNA 1993, Kearney and Peebles 1969 Common Name : Pringle's lipfern Rarity : None General : Perennial ferns, evergreen, with long and creeping rhizomes 1-3 mm in diameter, with abundant, small linear-lanceolate basal scales, these straight to slightly contorted, loosely appressed, dark, shining, and uniformly brown or with a poorly defined dark, central stripe, this usually persistent. Leaves : Clustered to somewhat scattered, blades ovate-deltate in outline, 3-pinnate-pinnatifid at the base, 1.5-5 cm wide, the dark color of the stalk continuing into the pinna bases, pinnae in many pairs, the basal pair conspicuously larger than the adjacent pair and unequal, the veins all free, not reaching the margins, clavate at the tips and mostly forked, pinnae 4-15 cm long with the ultimate divisions of the pinnae facing the base enlarged, surfaces with conspicuous, scattered, lanceolate scales on the midribs, abaxial scales in many series, these lanceolate, truncate or subcordate at the base and with erose tips, the largest 0.4-0.8 mm wide, loosely overlapping but not concealing the ultimate segments, surfaces not ciliate, ultimate segments spatulate, not especially beadlike, the largest usually 2-3 mm, abaxially glabrous or with a few small scales near the base and glabrous above, the midribs of the pinnae prominent, green adaxially for most of their length, other pinnae surfaces glabrous or nearly so, the rachis grooved above, the leaf arrangement in bud not coiled from the leaf downward. Sporangia : Confined to the submarginal vein tips or scattered along veins near the segment margins, usually protected by the reflexed leaf margins, containing 64 spores, these not intermixed with farina-producing glands, spores brown to black or gray, rarely yellowi Ecology : Found usually on igneous substrates, on rocky slopes and ledges, cliff bases, from 2,500-5,000 ft (762-1524 m); sporulating late spring-fall. Ethnobotany : Unknown, but other species in the genus have uses. Etymology : Cheilanthes is from Greek cheilos for lip and anthos for flower, while pringlei is named for Cyrus Guernsey Pringle (1838-1911) who collected for Asa Gray at Harvard.

Vegetative : Commonly 2-6 basal leaves, borne on the lower one-third of the stems, proximally v-shaped, lower ones reduced to blade-less sheaths, upper ones commonly 8-25 cm long, blades flat to involute, 0.5-4 mm wide, linear, leaf-like involucral bract solitary, 2-1 Inflorescence : Usually 1-6 spikelets, sessile or in a compact cluster, 7-20 mm long, scales yellows brown to reddish brown, scarious midrib prominent finishing in a mucro, this equal to or longer than apical notch of scale, 4-6 perianth bristles, these retrorsely barbed, 2-3 styles, the achenes brown lenticular to trigonous 2-3 mm long. Ecology : Found in water, streams, seeps, springs, marshy margins, lakes, and swamps from 3,000-7,500 ft (914-2286 m), flowers Distribution : Widespread species throughout North America. Notes : Similar to Schoenoplectus americanus, but without the deeply concave stem. Ethnobotany : The seeds were made into flour and mush. Etymology : Schoenoplectus coms from Greek schoinos for rush, reed or cord and plektos, for twisted or plaited, while pungens means sharply pointed Synonyms : Scirpus pungens, Scirpus badius, others see Tropicos Editor : SBuckley 2012']],\n",
